Description=AutoSSH Reverse Tunnel for Dozzle Docker Log Reader (port 9999->9998)
After=network.target

[Service]
# Run as the 'absclust_user' user and group
User=absclust_user
Group=absclust_user

# Important: This tells autossh to not use a monitoring port,
# but rely on SSH's ServerAlive options instead.
# -N: Do not execute a remote command (essential for port forwarding)
# -T: Disable pseudo-terminal allocation (good for non-interactive sessions)
# -R: The reverse tunnel specification.
#     Ensure [::1] (IPv6 loopback) is what you intend.
#     For IPv4 loopback, use 127.0.0.1:9999.
# -o ExitOnForwardFailure=yes: Important for reliability. If the tunnel fails to set up, exit so autossh retries.
# -o ServerAliveInterval=60: How often (seconds) to send a null packet to the remote host.
# -o ServerAliveCountMax=3: How many consecutive unresponsive intervals before disconnecting.
ExecStart=/usr/bin/autossh -M 0 -N -T -R 9998:[::1]:9999 user@v2.absclust.com -o ExitOnForwardFailure=yes -o ServerAliveInterval=60 -o ServerAliveCountMax=3

# If autossh itself crashes or exits (e.g., due to an unrecoverable error),
# systemd will restart it after a short delay.
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5s

# Give autossh some time to gracefully shut down the SSH tunnel before being killed.
TimeoutStopSec=30s

# Type=simple is the default, but explicitly stating it can be good for clarity.
# AutoSSH will be the main process.
Type=simple

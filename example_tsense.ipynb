Herein, the design and engineering of atomically thin 2D MXene flacks into nanofilms with a thickness of 20 nm for gas separation are reported. Well-stacked pristine MXene nanofilms are proven to show outstanding molecular sieving property for H2 preferential transport. Chemical tuning of the MXene nanochannels is also rationally designed for selective permeating CO2. Borate and polyethylenimine (PEI) molecules are well interlocked into MXene layers, realizing the delicate regulation of stacking behaviors and interlayer spacing of MXene nanosheets. The MXene nanofilms with either H2- or CO2-selective transport channels exhibit excellent gas separation performance beyond the limits for state-of-the-art membranes. The mechanisms within these nanoconfined MXene layers are discussed, revealing the transformation from “diffusion-controlled” to “solution-controlled” channels after chemical tuning. This work of precisely tailoring the 2D nanostructure may inspire the exploring of nanofluidics in 2D confined space with applications in many other fields like catalysis and energy conversion processes.\",\n",

A variety of methods have been recently developed to process MXenes into films or coatings for specific applications such as energy storage, optics, electronics, catalysts, and medical devices. This chapter reflects recent progress and outlines future prospects of these MXene processing methods. We provide a holistic overview of the state-of-the-art MXene processing methods for obtaining extremely thin films (e.g., spin coating and layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly) to bulk processing (e.g., 3D printing and stamping). In the following chapter, we describe the mechanisms of such processing techniques in detail when used with 2D MXenes.

Here, a rapid and broad-spectrum antibacterial strategy is demonstrated through photothermal ablation with MXene and light. Ti3C2 MXenes, when combined with 808 nm light, show significant antibacterial effects in just 20 min. The antibacterial strategy is effective to 15 bacterial species tested, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE). In addition, the rapid antibacterial strategy works for MRSA biofilms, by damaging the structures as well as killing bacteria in biofilms. Furthermore, the investigation of the antibacterial mechanisms shows that Ti3C2 with light kills bacteria mainly physically through inserting/contact and photothermal effect. This work broadens the potential applications of MXene and provides a way to eradicate bacteria and biofilms physically, without the likelihood of resistance development.',\n",

Here, MXene nanosheets with homogeneously anchored NiFe2O4 nanoparticles (NiFe2O4/MXene) were prepared using facial electrostatic self-assembling and freeze-drying technique. Interestingly, the minimum reflection loss (RLmin) of paraffin wax-based composites with only 3% NiFe2O4/MXene reached as low as\\u2009−\\u200941.83\\xa0dB, showing much stronger EMW absorption property than that of MXene nanosheets (RLmin\\u2009=\\u2009\\u2009−\\u20095.03\\xa0dB) at the same loading level. This can be mainly ascribed to the existence of NiFe2O4 nanoparticle that can effectively prevent the self-stacking of MXene nanosheets, causing improved conduction loss. Besides, large amounts of heterogeneous interfaces between NiFe2O4 nanoparticle and MXene can also produce additional interface polarization loss. More importantly, magnetic loss arising from the magnetic NiFe2O4 nanoparticle is beneficial for good impedance matching, enabling more EMW to enter into the interior of composites to be dissipated. Furthermore, effective absorption bandwidth in the frequency range of 3.44–18\\xa0GHz can be achieved by adjusting the matching thickness of composites with 5% NiFe2O4/MXene.

       "  'abstract': 'AbstractTransparent wood (TW) is a promising optical material, which provides a potential choice for windows applications. As a polymer composite material, the mechanical, thermal stability, and flame retardant of TW are crucial properties in practical applications. In this study, the delaminated Ti3C2Tx (MXene) were dispersed into polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and then infiltrated into delignified wood to prepare MXene-reinforced transparent wood (TW-MXene). The MXene addition leads to an interlocking mechanism between MXene fillers with a polymer matrix (e.g., PVA, cellulose scaffold), thereby improving the tensile strength of TW. Besides, the dynamic mechanical analysis also proved that the tensile strength of TW-MXene is significantly higher than pure transparent wood with changing the temperature at −50 to 150\\xa0°C. The TW added with 1 wt% MXene maintained a lower thermal conductivity of 0.31\\xa0W\\xa0m−1\\xa0K−1, and it showed better UV resistance than TW. Besides, the thermal decomposition rate of TW-MXene composite slows down, and its weight loss rate decreases with the addition of MXene. Furthermore, the presence of 1 wt% MXene endowed TW with 9.3 and 22.0% reductions for PHRR and THR, respectively. This strategy provides an insight into the development of high-performance transparent wood composites with the potential to be used in building fields.Graphical abstract',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\n\\nRecently, we developed highly fluorescent Ti3C2 and Nb2C Mxene quantum dots (QDs) for labeling of in vitro models. However, the mechanism of the toxicity of the prepared QDs was not explored before. In this study, we addressed the possible mechanism associated with cytotoxicity of the QDs to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Exposure to up to 100 μg/ml Ti3C2 but not Nb2C QDs for 24 h significantly induced cytotoxicity. The exposure also increased intracellular Ti and Nb elements, indicating the internalization of both types of QDs. None of the QDs promoted interleukin 6 (IL-6) and IL-8 releases. Rather, Ti3C2 QDs significantly reduced IL-6 and IL-8 release, indicating that the toxicity of Ti3C2 QDs was not due to elevated inflammatory responses. Exposure to Ti3C2 but not Nb2C QDs resulted in increased LC3B-II/I ratio and beclin-1 proteins, biomarkers of autophagy, as well as the accumulation of autophagic substance p62. Ti3C2 QDs also more effectively promoted pro-caspase 3 but not pro-caspase 8 compared with Nb2C QDs. Furthermore, pre-treatment with autophagic modulators altered the cytotoxicity of Ti3C2 QDs, which further confirmed the role of autophagic dysfunction in Ti3C2 QD-induced toxicity to HUVECs. In conclusion, the results from this study suggested that high levels of Ti3C2 QDs could induce cytotoxicity to HUVECs by inducing the dysfunction of autophagy. Nb2C QDs appeared to be more biocompatible to HUVECs compared with Ti3C2 QDs at the same mass concentrations, which suggested a role of composition of Mxene QDs to determine their toxicity to human endothelial cells.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\n\\n\\nHerein, the fabrication of terahertz (THz) polarizers is reported on by simply spin casting two-dimensional (2D) MXene Ti3C2Tz nanosheets on a photolithographically patterned THz-transparent substrate and subsequent immersion in acetone. Lines 30\\u2009nm-thick and 10–20\\u2009μm wide result in electric field (E) extinction ratios (ER) of up to 3\\u2009dB, or power ER of up to 6\\u2009dB. Simulations show the possibility of achieving ER beyond 16\\u2009dB, or power ER higher than 32\\u2009dB by increasing the thickness of the MXene lines to 1.5–2\\u2009μm and optimizing the metasurface patterns. The Ti3C2Tz nanosheets are solution-processed and can be deposited on a variety of substrates, including flexible ones. Once encapsulated, chemically stable THz polarizers, that combine high performance and low production costs, can be readily manufactured, with characteristics that compare favorably with the much more involved metallic wire grid polarizers, including gold and tungsten. Moreover, recent demonstration of dynamic tunability of Ti3C2Tz THz conductivity by ultrafast optical pulses opens the possibility of using MXene wire-grids in high-speed THz modulators.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Since technology progresses, the need to optimize the thermal system’s heat transfer efficiency is continuously confronted by researchers. A primary constraint in the production of heat transfer fluids needed for ultra-high performance was its intrinsic poor heat transfer properties. MXene, a novel 2D nanoparticle possessing fascinating properties has emerged recently as a potential heat dissipative solute in nanofluids. In this research, 2D MXenes (Ti3C2) are synthesized via chemical etching and blended with a binary solution containing Diethylene Glycol (DEG) and ionic liquid (IL) to formulate stable nanofluids at concentrations of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 wt%. Furthermore, the effect of different temperatures on the studied liquid’s thermophysical characteristics such as thermal conductivity, density, viscosity, specific heat capacity, thermal stability and the rheological property was experimentally conducted. A computational analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of ionic liquid-based 2D MXene nanofluid (Ti3C2/DEG+IL) in hybrid photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) systems. A 3D numerical model is developed to evaluate the thermal efficiency, electrical efficiency, heat transfer coefficient, pumping power and temperature distribution. The simulations proved that the studied working fluid in the PV/T system results in an enhancement of thermal efficiency, electrical efficiency and heat transfer coefficient by 78.5%, 18.7% and 6%, respectively.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Due to easy re-stacking, low yield of few-layered MXenes (f-MXenes), the applications of MXenes are mainly restricted in multi-layered MXenes (m-MXenes) state. Although f-MXenes can be prepared from m-MXenes, after exfoliation process, a mass of sediments which are still essentially compact MXenes are usually directly discarded, leading to low utilization of raw m-MXenes. Herein, a classified preparation strategy is adopted to exploit the raw m-MXenes and traditional MXenes sediments, taking multi-layered Ti3C2Tx MXene as an example. Via rational delamination and subsequent treatment to Ti3C2Tx sediments, we succeed in achieving classified and large-scale preparation of various Ti3C2Tx MXene derivatives, including few-layered Ti3C2Tx (f-Ti3C2Tx) powders, f-Ti3C2Tx films, and Ti3C2Tx MXene-derived nanowires with heterostructure of potassium titanate and Ti3C2Tx. We demonstrate the necessity of “step-by-step delamination” towards traditional Ti3C2Tx sediments to improve the yield of f-Ti3C2Tx from 15% to 72%; the feasibility of “solution-phase flocculation (SPF)” to fundamentally solve the re-stacking phenomenon, and oxidation degradation issues of f-Ti3C2Tx during storage; as well as the convenience of SPF to deal with time-consuming issues of fabricating Ti3C2Tx films. What’s more, alkali-heat treatment of final Ti3C2Tx sediments turns waste into treasure of Ti3C2Tx-derived nanowires, leading to 100% utilization of raw Ti3C2Tx. The content of one-dimensional (1D) nanowires in the hybrids can be adjusted by controlling alkalization time. The 3D architecture heterostructure composed of 1D nanowires and 2D nanosheets exhibits gorgeous application potential. This work can expand preparation and application of various MXenes derivatives, promoting process of various MXenes.',\n",

Here we employ density functional theory calculations to direct atomic-level exploration, design and fabrication of a MXene material, Ti3C2 nanoparticles, as a highly efficient co-catalyst. Ti3C2 nanoparticles are rationally integrated with cadmium sulfide via a hydrothermal strategy to induce a super high visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen production activity of 14,342\\u2009μmol\\u2009h−1g−1 and an apparent quantum efficiency of 40.1% at 420\\u2009nm. This high performance arises from the favourable Fermi level position, electrical conductivity and hydrogen evolution capacity of Ti3C2 nanoparticles. Furthermore, Ti3C2 nanoparticles also serve as an efficient co-catalyst on ZnS or ZnxCd1−xS. This work demonstrates the potential of earth-abundant MXene family materials to construct numerous high performance and low-cost photocatalysts/photoelectrodes. Solar hydrogen production through photocatalytic water splitting requires active and stable co-catalysts to replace platinum.

       "  'abstract': 'AbstractA bi-metallic titanium–tantalum carbide MXene, TixTa(4−x)C3 is successfully prepared via etching of Al atoms from parent TixTa(4−x)AlC3 MAX phase for the first time. X-ray diffractometer and Raman spectroscopic analysis proved the crystalline phase evolution from the MAX phase to the lamellar MXene arrangements. Also, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) study confirmed that the synthesized MXene is free from Al after hydro fluoric acid (HF) etching process as well as partial oxidation of Ti and Ta. Moreover, the FE-SEM and TEM characterizations demonstrate the exfoliation process tailored by the TixTa(4−x)C3 MXene after the Al atoms from its corresponding MAX TixTa(4−x)AlC3 phase, promoting its structural delamination with an expanded interlayer d-spacing, which can allow an effective reversible Li-ion storage. The lamellar TixTa(4−x)C3 MXene demonstrated a reversible specific discharge capacity of 459 mAhg−1 at an applied C-rate of 0.5 °C with a capacity retention of 97% over 200 cycles. An excellent electrochemical redox performance is attributed to the formation of a stable, promising bi-metallic MXene material, which stores Li-ions on the surface of its layers. Furthermore, the TixTa(4−x)C3 MXene anode demonstrate a high rate capability as a result of its good electron and Li-ion transport, suggesting that it is a promising candidate as Li-ion anode material.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'AbstractSelf-healing materials (SHMs) with unique mechanical and electronic properties are promising for self-reparable electronics and robots. However, the self-healing ability of emerging two-dimensional (2D) materials, for instance, MXenes, has not been systematically investigated, which limits their applications in self-healing electronics. Herein, we report the homogeneous self-healing assembly (homo-SHA) of MXene and the heterogeneous self-healing assembly (hetero-SHA) of MXene and graphene oxide (GO) under moisture treatments. The self-healing mechanism has been attributed to the hydration induced interlayer swelling of MXene and GO and the recombination of hydrogen bond networks after water desorption. The multiform hetero-SHA of MXene and GO not only enables facile fabrication of free-standing soft electronics and robots, but also endows the resultant devices with damage-healing properties. As proof-of-concept demonstrations, free-standing soft electronic devices including a generator, a humidity sensor, a pressure sensor, and several robotic devices have been fabricated. The hetero-SHA of MXene and GO is simple yet effective, and it may pioneer a new avenue to develop miniature soft electronics and robots based on 2D materials.Graphical abstractDownload : Download high-res image (51KB)Download : Download full-size image',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Ti2CO2, as the representative MXene with semiconducting characteristics and ultrahigh carrier mobility, has attracted increasing attention in material science. Herein, various Ti2CO2 alloys with Ti displaced by neighboring elements Sc and V, or C by B and N are investigated in this paper based on the first-principles density functional calculations. The structures and mechanical and electronic properties are thoroughly studied for the configurations with varying alloying atom concentrations. The choices of alloying elements play a critical role in determining the lattice parameters and layer thickness. The Sc substitutions generally increase the lattice parameter but decrease the layer thickness. In contrast, the introduction of N presents slight influence on the structural parameters. The mechanical strength shows remarkable variations by introducing the alloying elements. The maximum elastic constant c\\n11 is determined to be 425\\xa0GPa in (Ti0.25V0.75)2CO2, and the corresponding minimum value is only 104\\xa0GPa found in (Ti0.125Sc0.875)2CO2. With respect to the electronic properties, although B and Sc both present one less valance electron compared to their replaced elements C and Ti, it is easier to realize the p-type semiconductor in the configurations containing Sc. Both the V and N substitutions are capable of generating n-type semiconductors, but their optimal stoichiometric compositions are quite different. Among all the configurations investigated, only (Ti0.5V0.5)2CO2 and (Ti0.375V0.625)2CO2 are magnetic, with their magnetism determined to be 2.61\\xa0uB/cell and 1.52\\xa0uB/cell, respectively. Thus, the method of alloying neighboring elements provides an effective approach in manipulating the physical properties of the Ti2CO2, which might widen the possible applications of MXene materials.',\n",

Also, the establishment of straightforward electrode fabrication methods with the aim to hinder the restack and/or aggregation of electrode materials, which limits the performance of the electrode, is of great significant. In this study, unidirectional freeze casting and inkjet-based 3D printing are combined to fabricate macroscopic porous aerogels with vertically aligned Ti3C2Tx sheets. The fabrication method is developed to easily control the aerogel microstructure and alignment of the MXene sheets. The aerogels show excellent electromechanical performance so that they can withstand almost 50% compression before recovering to the original shape and maintain their electrical conductivities during continuous compression cycles. To enhance the electrochemical performance, an inkjet-printed MXene current collector layer is added with horizontally aligned MXene sheets. This combines the superior electrical conductivity of the current collector layer with the improved ionic diffusion provided by the porous electrode. The cells fabricated with horizontal MXene sheets alignment as current collector with subsequent vertical MXene sheets alignment layers show the best electrochemical performance with thickness-independent capacitive behavior.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\n\\nSolar anti-/deicing can solve icing problems by converting sunlight into heat. One of the biggest problems, which has long been plaguing the design of solar anti-/deicing surfaces, is that photothermal materials are always lightproof and appear black, because of the mutual exclusiveness between generating heat and retaining transparency. Herein, a highly transparent and scalable solar anti-/deicing surface is reported, which enables the coated glass to exhibit high transparency (>77% transmittance at 550\\xa0nm) and meanwhile causes a >30 °C\\xa0surface temperature increase relative to the ambient environment under 1.0 sun illumination. Such a transparent anti-/deicing surface can be fabricated onto a large class of substrates (e.g., glass, ceramics, metals, plastics), by applying a solid omniphobic slippery coating onto layer-by-layer-assembled ultrathin MXene multilayers. Hence, the surface possesses a self-cleaning ability to shed waterborne and oil-based liquids thanks to residue-free slipping motion. Passive anti-icing and active deicing capabilities are, respectively, obtained on the solar thermal surface, which effectively prevents water from freezing and simultaneously melts pre-formed ice and thick frost. The self-cleaning effect enables residue-free removal of unfrozen water and interfacially melted ice/frost to boost the anti-/deicing efficiency. Importantly, the surface is capable of self-healing under illumination to repair physical damage and chemical degradation.',\n",

In this work, an easily-operating strategy to prepare Ti3C2Tx MXene/polybenzoxazine (PBZ) composites with homogeneous dispersion and enhanced comprehensive properties is reported, in which the rich polar groups on MXene surface and purposefully constructed hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) play crucial roles. Specifically, the oxygen and fluorine-containing terminations on Ti3C2Tx MXene surface were increased by varied etching conditions. Then, the composites were prepared by solvent-assisted drop-casting and annealing method. The H-bonds between MXene and benzoxazine can not only accelerate the ring-opening polymerization, but also enhance their interfacial interactions. Accordingly, the obtained composites exhibited excellent comprehensive properties, showing the enhancement in tensile strength of 22.1%, impact strength of 50%, and thermal conductivity of 67.3% when the filler content was only 2\\xa0wt%.

Characterization of the prepared coated electrode was conducted by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX).

Nevertheless, the low stability exhibited by MXenes in moist air or water limits their long-term storage and wide applications. This work proposes a composite of sodium ascorbate-decorated MXene (SA-MXene) by combining ascorbate ions with Ti3C2Tx  MXene synthesized through a minimally intensive layer delamination (MILD) process. The synthesizing and decoration of MXene with SA to obtain SA-MXene had been shown to be a viable method for avoiding Ti3C2Tx  MXene materials from oxidizing. The as-prepared SA-MXene was formulated as screen-printing ink with high stability and oxidation resistance despite being stored at ambient temperature after 30 days. Furthermore, a flexible humidity sensor was assembled by screen-printing technology with SA-MXene ink as the humidity-sensitive layer on the copper interdigital electrode prepared by the electrodeless deposition (ELD) process. Consequently, the SA-MXene sensor showed remarkable potential in humidity sensing with an ultrahigh relative capacitance sensitivity (40.12 nF/% RH) and rapid response across a wide detection range.

Developing highly efficient catalysts to improve catalytic activity and alleviate oxidation–reduction overpotential of Li–O2 batteries is of great challenge and importance. Herein, a CO2-assisted thermal-reaction strategy is developed to fabricate isolated semi-metallic selenium single-atom-doped Ti3C2 MXene catalyst (SASe-Ti3C2) as cathodes for high-performance Li–O2 batteries. The isolated moieties of single Se atom catalysis centers can function as active catalytic centers to drastically enhance the intrinsic LiO2-absorption ability and thus fundamentally modulate the formation/decomposition mechanism of lithium peroxide (Li2O2) discharge product, thus demonstrating greatly enhanced redox kinetics and efficiently ameliorated overpotentials. Theoretical simulations reveal that the interaction between Se-involved moieties and Ti3C2 substrate greatly enhances the intrinsic LiO2-absorption ability and fundamentally promotes the charge transfer between electrode and Li2O2 product, deeply ameliorating the round-trip overpotential. The well-designed SASe–Ti3C2 electrode exhibits decreased charge/discharge polarization (1.10\\xa0V vs Li/Li+), ultrahigh discharge capacity (17\\xa0260\\xa0mAh\\xa0g−1 at 100\\xa0mA\\xa0g−1), and superior durability (170 cycles at 200\\xa0mA\\xa0g−1) as cathode for Li–O2 batteries.

       "  'abstract': 'Herein, a high-performance Ag3PO4/TiO2@C composite photocatalyst was successfully fabricated through the unique structure and interface designs. Firstly, a novel three-dimensional layered carbon-supported titanium dioxides (TiO2@C) nanosheets (NSs) are fabricated by employing the new-type two-dimensional layered transition metal Ti3C2 MXene as carbon skeleton and homologous titanium source via a facile hydrothermal method. Benefiting from the structure characters of Ti3C2 MXene and in-situ growth, the as-prepared TiO2@C NSs own a large surface area and good interface contact. On this basis, taking\\xa0advantage\\xa0of\\xa0the surface electronegativity of Ti3C2 MXene drove TiO2@C, Ag3PO4 nanoparticles are further combined with TiO2@C via an electrostatic self-assembly method to improve the light-harvesting ability. The electrostatic self-assembly process is beneficial to the uniform growth of Ag3PO4 nanoparticles and the formation of a good heterostructure interface between Ag3PO4 and TiO2@C. Therefore, the as-prepared Ag3PO4/TiO2@C composites as photocatalyst exhibit excellent photocatalytic performance, and the optimal photocatalytic degradation rate constant for methylene blue achieves 4.768\\u2009×\\u200910–2\\xa0min−1. The enhanced photocatalytic performance is mainly attributed to the synergistic\\xa0effect\\xa0of larger surface area, better light-harvesting ability, and superior charge transfer and separation characters. Additionally, the growth and optimization mechanisms are also deeply studied in the present paper.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\n               Growing concerns about fossil fuel’s environmental impact, along with the recent breakthrough of electric vehicles, have turned research focus to energy storage solutions. Despite the fact that batteries were invented about 200 years ago, modern technologies are required to store energy in a larger grid with a high density. The electrode materials used in energy storage devices such as batteries and supercapacitors play a major role in their overall performance. A lot of materials have been explored but due to appealing electrical and electrochemical properties, MXene has received a lot of interest for energy storage devices. Because of their layered structure and high conductivity, MXenes are promising candidates for energy storage applications. Two-dimensional heterostructured materials are more advantageous than individual building blocks for batteries and supercapacitors. In this review work, we looked at different MXene based heterostructures and their electrochemical performance as electrode materials of batteries. A particular application of MXene in Lithium-ion batteries has been studied. Synthesis and characteristics of MXenes are briefly discussed here.

       "  'abstract': 'The ability to probe and manipulate electrophysiology at the cellular level is crucial for understanding cellular communications and enabling new therapeutics for neurological and psychiatric disorders. Nanomaterial-facilitated photothermal stimulation is a non-invasive technique to manipulate cellular electrophysiology with high spatial precision and rapid response time without the need of genetic modifications. Although recently reported Si-, Au-, and C-based nanomaterials are promising candidates for photothermal stimulation of electrically active cells and tissues, they exhibit limited photothermal conversion efficiency in the near-infrared (NIR) window or have complicated synthesis protocols that prevents direct scale-up. Two-dimensional (2D) Ti3C2 MXene is a promising candidate for optical stimulation due to its high NIR absorption and photothermal energy conversion efficiency. Here, we report an approach for optical modulation of neuronal activity using Ti3C2 MXene flakes. Under illumination with 1 ms pulses of 10 mW NIR laser (λ = 808 nm), the local temperature rise induced by single Ti3C2 MXene flakes was measured to be 3.1 ± 0.7 K. MXene films (25 µg/cm2) and dispersed MXene flakes (100 µg/mL) were evaluated to be biocompatible with dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons. Both MXene films and flakes enabled photothermal stimulation of DRG neurons (and DRG networks) with incident energies in the micro-joule regime. Optical stimulation of DRG neurons using Ti3C2 MXene flakes is safe and does not generate cellular stress. Due to its straightforward and large-scale synthesis, MXene can enable neuronal modulation at various scales and dimensions, thus is a powerful tool for future remote, non-genetic biological interfaces.',\n",

Traditional assembly approaches of 3D MXene aerogels normally involve external binders/templates and/or additional functionalization, which sacrifice the electrical conductivities and electrochemical activities of MXene aerogels. Herein, inspired by the hierarchal scale textures of Phrynosoma cornutum, a crumple-textured Ti3C2Tx MXene platform is engineered to facilitate Mg2+-induced assembly, enabling conformal formation of large-area Mg2+-MXene aerogels without polymeric binders. Through a doctor blading technique and freeze drying, the Mg2+-MXene aerogels are produced with customized shapes/dimensions, featuring high surface area (140.5 m2 g−1), superior electrical conductivity (758.4 S m−1), and high robustness in water. The highly conductive MXene aerogels show their versatile applications from macroscale technologies (e.g., electromagnetic interference shielding and capacitive deionization (CDI)) to on-chip electronics (e.g., quasi-solid-state microsupercapacitors (QMSCs)). As CDI electrodes, the Mg2+-MXene aerogels exhibit high salt adsorption capacity (33.3\\xa0mg g−1) and long-term operation reliability (over 30 cycles), showing a superb comparison with the literature. Also, the QMSCs with interdigitated Mg2+-MXene aerogel electrodes demonstrate high areal capacitances (409.3 mF cm−2) with superior power density and energy density compared with other state-of-art QMSCs.\",\n",

A good example is the fabrication of graphene oxide (GO) where the high resistive precursor of graphene that has to be reduced to recover its favorable optoelectronic properties. In most cases, ultra-high temperature (>1000ºC) and toxic chemicals (hydrazine) have to be used. In this talk, we will present a novel solution-processed film containing T3C2Tx monolayers, a 2D crystal from the recently discovered family of MXenes(3). This new MXene 2D family can be synthetized by selectively etching the A element of the MAX phase and formed into stacks of transition metal carbides and carbonitrides. Indeed, MXenes have recently gained attention due their a hydrophilic behavior, high metallic conductivity and excellent mechanical properties(4). \\n               Herein, we explore the use of freestanding nanometer-thin films of T3C2Tx for solution-processed transparent conductive electrodes.

In this talk, we will show that by using a simple spin-coating technique we can control the number of flakes forming the film (Figure 1a) and optimize the optoelectronic properties of our films so that they exhibit a figure of merit twice as large as reduced-GO (Figure 1b). The novelty of our approach is our in deep understanding of the limiting factors in the resistivity of the films such as heat treatments and functional end-groups. In addition, we will illustrate their metallic behavior by on-chip measurements and report for the first time the experimental measurement of their work function, which is crucial for advanced device design. \\n               This demonstration of a novel metallic and solution-processed 2D material with high conductivity using T3C2Txflakes with low-temperature fabrication provides a new possible pathway towards scalable manufacturing of ultrathin film devices. \\n               1.

In this work, we investigated the aggregates of sulfanilic acid-modified MXene (abbreviated as MXene-SO3H) with three model dyes at the air–water interface and demonstrated the morphological and aggregation changes of composite films, using Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) technology, as well as excellent uniformity and reproducibility by using surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectra. This research has found that cationic dye molecules were adsorbed onto negatively charged MXene-SO3H particles mainly through electrostatic interaction and the particles induced dyes to form highly ordered nanostructures including H- and/or J-aggregates corresponding to monomers in bulk solution. The surface pressure-area isotherms from different dye sub phases confirmed that the stable composite films have been successfully formed. And the spectral results reveal that different dyes have different types of aggregations. In addition, the SERS spectra indicated that the optimal layers of MXene-SO3H/methylene blue (MB) films was 50 layers using rhodamine 6G (R6G) as probe molecule. And the formed 50 layers of MXene-SO3H/MB films (MXene-SO3H/MB-50) as SERS substrate were proved to possess excellent uniformity and repeatability.',\n",

In this work, Ti3C2Tx MXene-derived quantum dots (Ti3C2Tx QDs) with abundant active sites enable the development of efficient NRR electrocatalysts. Given surface functional groups play a key role on the electrocatalytic performance, density functional theory calculations are first conducted, clarifying that hydroxyl groups on Ti3C2Tx offer excellent NRR activity. Accordingly, hydroxyl-rich Ti3C2Tx QDs (Ti3C2OH QDs) are synthesized as NRR catalysts by alkalization and intercalation. This material offers an NH3 yield and Faradaic efficiency of 62.94 µg h−1 mg−1cat. and 13.30% at −0.50 V, respectively, remarkably higher than reported MXene catalysts. This work demonstrates that MXene catalysts can be mediated through the optimization of both QDs sizes and functional groups for efficient ammonia production at room temperature.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\n\\nMXenes, 2D transition metal carbides, and nitrides have attracted tremendous interest because of their metallic conductivity, solution processability, and excellent merits in energy storage and other applications. However, the pristine MXene films often suffer from poor ambient stability and mechanical properties that stem from their polar terminal groups and weak interlayer interactions. Here, a heteroatom doping strategy is developed to tailor the surface functionalities of MXene, followed by the addition of large-sized reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as conductive additives to achieve a scalable production of S, N-MXene/rGO (SNMG-40) hybrid film with high mechanical strength (≈45\\xa0MPa) and energy storage properties (698.5\\xa0F\\xa0cm−3). Notably, the SNMG-40 film also demonstrates long-term cycling stability (≈98% capacitance retention after 30\\xa0000 cycles), which can be maintained under ambient condition or immersed in H2SO4 electrolyte for more than 100 days. The asymmetric supercapacitor (aMGSC) based on SNMG-40 film shows an ultrahigh energy density of 22.3\\xa0Wh\\xa0kg−1, which is much higher than those previously reported MXene-based materials. Moreover, the aMGSC also provides excellent mechanical durability under different deformation conditions. Thus, this strategy makes MXene materials more competitive for real-world applications such as flexible electronics and electromagnetic interference shielding.',\n",

We demonstrated a possibility of designing 2D/2D BiVO4/MXene heterojunction with excellent charge separation efficiency by density functional theory (DFT) and realized the preparation by hydrothermal method based on the theoretical results. As expected, the as-constructed composites exhibited an unprecedented photocatalytic activity for simultaneous removal of hexavalent chromium (83.6\\u2009%) and methylene blue (88.7\\u2009%) within 120\\u2005minutes under visible light by photogenerated electrons and holes respectively, which were 2.17- and 3.67-times compared with pristine BiVO4. This significant improvement is ascribed to the strong interfacial interaction within the unique 2D/2D heterojunction, which greatly improves the lifetime of charge carriers by reducing the recombination and shortening the transmission distance.

Herein, we further applied the technology of fabricating two-dimensional material into the synaptic thin-film transistors. The devices exhibited the typical regulated postsynaptic current behaviors under the visible light and gate bias inputs. Moreover, a color detecting sensor was built up based on the synaptic properties, through which the stained fluorescent cells were identified correctly. Finally, we further applied the synaptic transistors into the human eye simulation projects. The adjustable nonlinear characteristic of the conductance rise led to the tunable light sensitivity image processing results under the dark and bright environments. All these outcomes revealed the great potential of the proposed transistors in establishing high-efficiency and energy-saving hardware neuromorphic systems for in-memory computing.',\n",

In this work, biodegradable poly(lactic acid) (PLA)/carbon nanotubes (CNTs)/Ti3C2Tx MXene nanocomposites are prepared via co-coagulation and compression molding techniques. The distribution state of Ti3C2Tx MXene or CNTs, the excellent conductivity and EMI-shielding properties of the nanocomposites are confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), four-probe conductivity tester and vector network analyzer, respectively. The PLA/CNTs/Ti3C2Tx nanocomposites show efficient EMI SE of 24.4\\xa0dB for 7 wt% CNTs/8 wt% Ti3C2Tx at the thickness of 0.5\\xa0mm. By increasing the thickness of the film, the EMI SE of PLA/CNTs/Ti3C2Tx nanocomposites can be increased to 39.6\\xa0dB at 1.9\\xa0mm, nearly 99.989% of electromagnetic wave is shielded. The EM wave reflection is the main shielding mechanism of the PLA/CNTs/Ti3C2Tx nanocomposites.

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\n\\nNiobium carbide (Nb2C), a newly developed 2D MXene material, has attracted much attention due to its outstanding electronic and optical properties. In this work, few-layer 2D Nb2C nanosheets are synthesized by magnetron sputtering deposition method. Z-scan measurements with pump source operating at 1.0 µm are performed to study the third-order nonlinear optical response, revealing excellent light modulation capabilities of 2D Nb2C. The effective nonlinear absorption coefficient (βeff\\xa0≈\\xa0–105 cm\\xa0GW–1) caused by saturable absorption effect is determined to be two orders of magnitude larger than that induced by reverse saturable absorption processes (two-photon absorption, etc.). The positive nonlinear refractive index n2 is determined to be ≈10–13\\xa0m2\\xa0W–1 for the first time. Moreover, by decorating 2D Nb2C onto microfiber, microfiber-based 2D Nb2C saturable absorber is fabricated and applied for compact square-wave pulse mode-locking ytterbium-fiber laser. The pulse duration of SWP increases from 0.652 to 1.616 ns with the pulse energy increasing linearly up to 0.89 nJ while the peak power remains a constant. The results not only verify the capability of 2D Nb2C as an optical modulator, but also pave a new way for exploring SWP laser sources.',\n",

In this study, biocompatible MXene quantum dot (MQD)/watermelon peel (WMP) aerogels were obtained by immersing freeze-dried fresh watermelon peel into the quantum dot dispersion. The resulting bio-aerogels with a three-dimensional (3D) porous network structure exhibited a low in elasticity modulus (0.03 MPa) and limit of detection (0.4 Pa) and it showed biocompatibility.

In addition, the sensing signals could be displayed on mobile phones through a Bluetooth module to monitor human motion (pulse, sound, and walking) in real time. More importantly, the MQD/WMP aerogels exhibited excellent biocompatibility in a cytotoxicity test, thus decreasing the safety risk when they are applied to human skin.

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\n\\n2D titanium carbide (Ti3C2Tx MXene) has potential application in flexible/transparent conductors because of its metallic conductivity and solution processability. However, solution-processed Ti3C2Tx films suffer from poor hydration stability and mechanical performance that stem from the presence of intercalants, which are unavoidably introduced during the preparation of Ti3C2Tx suspension. A proton acid colloidal processing approach is developed to remove the extrinsic intercalants in Ti3C2Tx film materials, producing pristine Ti3C2Tx films with significantly enhanced conductivity, mechanical strength, and environmental stability. Typically, pristine Ti3C2Tx films show more than twofold higher conductivity (10 400 S cm−1 vs 4620 S cm−1) and up to 11- and 32-times higher strength and strain energy at failure (112 MPa, 1,480 kJ m−3, vs 10 MPa, 45 kJ m−3) than films prepared without proton acid processing. Simultaneously, the conductivity and mechanical integrity of pristine films are also largely retained during the long-term storage in H2O/O2 environment. The improvement in mechanical performance and conductivity is originated from the intrinsic strong interaction between Ti3C2Tx layers, and the absence of extrinsic intercalants makes pristine Ti3C2Tx films stable in humidity by blocking the intercalation of H2O/O2. This method makes the material more competitive for real-world applications such as electromagnetic interference shielding.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\nCapacitive deionization (CDI) is one of the most promising energy-efficient technologies for water desalination, however its industrial translation is slow and impeded by limited electrosorption capacity, slow electrosorption rate and poor cycling stability. Herein  we address the above challenges by developing and validating a new concept of unimpeded and selective full-cell anion-cation separation using custom-designed anion-kinetics-selective anode and cation-energy-selective cathode.  The nanoporous graphene anode enables the selective anion kinetics, while the cation selectivity on the functionalized MXene cathode is due to the difference in ion adsorption energy. These mechanisms are validated by electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance measurements.  The finely-tuned balance between ion transport and adsorption causes unimpeded ion diffusion leading to the higher electrosorption rates. These effects are guided by the atomistic and quantum chemistry simulations, and are confirmed experimentaly by tuning the pore size of graphene anode and the functionalization of MXene cathode. The fabricated asymmetric CDI cell exhibits superior electrosorption capacity of 49 mg g−1  , high electrosorption rate of 2.92 mg g−1 min−1 and low energy consumption of 0.38 Wh g−1 in 5000 mg L−1 NaCl solution as well as excellent cycling stability (100 cycles), which are among the best of the current state-of-the-art CDI studies. These results demonstrate the design of advanced electrode materials for the effective control of ion kinetics and energies to achieve the selective ion transport, thus providing new insights for a broader range of energy-related applications.',\n",

Transition-metal carbides (MXenes) have recently drawn attention as potential co-catalyst candidates for photocatalysts. Here, we report niobium pentoxide/carbon/niobium carbide (MXene) hybrid materials (Nb2O5/C/Nb2C) as photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution from water splitting. The Nb2O5/C/Nb2C composites were synthesized by one-step CO2 oxidation of Nb2CTx. Nb2O5 grew homogeneously on Nb2C after mild oxidation, during which some amorphous carbon was also formed. With an optimized oxidation time of 1.0\\u2005h, Nb2O5/C/Nb2C showed the highest hydrogen generation rate (7.81\\u2005μmol\\u2009h−1\\u2009gcat−1), a value that was four times higher than that of pure Nb2O5. The enhanced performance of Nb2O5/C/Nb2C was attributed to intimate contact between Nb2O5 and conductive Nb2C and the separation of photogenerated charge carriers at the Nb2O5/Nb2C interface; the results presented herein show that transition-metal carbide are promising co-catalysts for photocatalytic hydrogen production.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\n        Neural networks are one of the first major milestones in developing artificial intelligence systems. The utilisation of integrated photonics in neural networks offers a promising alternative approach to microelectronic and hybrid optical-electronic implementations due to improvements in computational speed and low energy consumption in machine-learning tasks. However, at present, most of the neural network hardware systems are still electronic-based due to a lack of optical realisation of the nonlinear activation function. Here, we experimentally demonstrate two novel approaches for implementing an all-optical neural nonlinear activation function based on utilising unique light-matter interactions in 2D Ti3C2Tx (MXene) in the infrared (IR) range in two configurations: 1) a saturable absorber made of MXene thin film, and 2) a silicon waveguide with MXene flakes overlayer. These configurations may serve as nonlinear units in photonic neural networks, while their nonlinear transfer function can be flexibly designed to optimise the performance of different neuromorphic tasks, depending on the operating wavelength. The proposed configurations are reconfigurable and can therefore be adjusted for various applications without the need to modify the physical structure. We confirm the capability and feasibility of the obtained results in machine-learning applications via an Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) handwritten digit classifications task, with near 99% accuracy. Our developed concept for an all-optical neuron is expected to constitute a major step towards the realization of all-optically implemented deep neural networks.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The development of cationic vacancies has been extensively examined as an effective strategy to improve the activity of electrocatalysts. However, it is a challenge to effectively introduce cationic vacancies on the material surface. Their specific effects on the electrochemical performance of lithium-oxygen (Li-O2) batteries are rarely reported. In this work, vanadium pentoxide with abundant vanadium vacancies (V2−xO5) is in situ prepared on the V2C MXene (V2−xO5@V2C MXene) surface, and their bifunctional catalytic activity toward the oxygen electrode reaction in Li-O2 batteries is systematically examined. The results show that the V2−xO5@V2C MXene-based Li-O2 battery exhibits excellent performance. It delivers a high energy efficiency of 83.4% at 100 mA g−1 and excellent cycling performance of more than 500 cycles. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations confirm that the presence of cationic vanadium vacancies can provide abundant active sites to reduce the reaction barrier and optimize the adsorption of reactants, increasing the oxygen electrode reactions in the Li-O2 battery. This work provides a meaningful view that modulating the electronic structure by creating cationic metal vacancies can improve the electrocatalytic activity of transition metal oxides.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\nAchieving higher energy storage and controllable energy release processes is the major research goal in solid propellants. Combustion catalysts are applied to modify the energy release behavior of solid propellants, but at the expense of lowering the total energy density of the propellants owing to their non-energetic feature. Here, with AP based propellant as proof-of-concept material, we demonstrate a reactive combustion catalyst strategy based on the clever use of the novel structure of Ti3C2 MXene, including appropriate reactivity, high energy storage and large specific surface area. It is found that the Ti3C2  MXene could first react with AP as fuel, releasing large amount of heat and in-situ generating TiOx/C nanosheets. The resulting TiOx/C nanosheets can further catalyze the thermal decomposition of AP by accelerating both electron and proton transfer during AP decomposition. As expected, the Ti3C2 MXene not only improves the pyrolysis reaction kinetics of AP based composites, but also increases the energy output of the propellants. The development of reactive catalysts with excellent catalytic activity and increased energy release provides a new strategy for design of solid propellants.',\n",

The electrochemical HER performance of the as-synthesized Pt NCs-MXene catalyst was investigated in an acid electrolyte. The results showed that at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, the overpotential and Tafel slope of the Pt NCs-MXene were 40 mV and 50.8 mV dec−1, respectively, lower than those of the commercial 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst.

However, the scalable self-assembly of flexible thin MXene films with high conductivity as well as excellent mechanical and electrochemical properties is still a challenge. Herein, a synchronous reduction and self-assembly strategy to fabricate flexible MXene films is developed, where MXene films are synchronously reduced and self-assembled on the Zn foil surface. Furthermore, the self-assembly of MXene films can be scaled up by controlling the area of Zn substrates. By adjusting the patterns of Zn substrates, the interdigital MXene patterns can also be obtained via a selectively reducing/assembling process. The resultant MXene films demonstrate high electrical conductivity, large specific surface area, and excellent mechanical properties. Thus they can serve as the electrodes of flexible supercapacitor devices directly. As a proof of concept, flexible sandwich and microsized supercapacitors are designed based on the above MXene film electrodes. Both sandwich and microsized supercapacitors display stable electrochemical performance under various bending states. This study provides a route to achieve large-area MXene-based films or microsized structures for applications in the field of energy storage.',\n",

In recent years, the half-metallicity and the magnetic properties of the MXene materials have been the research hotspots of new materials due to their unique crystal characteristics and wide applications.

In this work, an all-optical modulator using MXene Ti3C2Tx deposited on a microfiber is proposed. By inserting an MXene-deposited phase shifter into one arm of a Mach–Zehnder interferometer, the MXene Ti3C2Tx absorbs the control light and generates heat, which induces significant refractive index changes through strong light–matter interactions and thermo-optic effects. In this study, a maximum phase shift of 16π is obtained, and an efficient all-optical switch with an extinction ratio of more than 18.53 dB and a rise time constant of 4.10 ms are demonstrated. The advantages of this modulator include its all-fiber content, low cost, ease of integration, and compactness. All-optical modulators based on thermo-optical effects will play an active role in the future of optical communications and optical information processing.',\n",

This work reports a high-performance MSC based on Ti3C2Tx-layer/MnO2-nanorod with an ionic liquid gel electrolyte, achieving a high areal capacitance of 24.7 mF cm−2 within a wide voltage window of 2.5 V. The specific layer–rod interlaced structure of Ti3C2Tx/MnO2 is designed to solve the inaccessibility of large-sized ions in ionic liquids into Ti3C2Tx layers. As a result, the structure modification provides an enhanced capacitance because the expanded interspace enables a sufficient number of large-sized ions to intercalate/deintercalate. This work provides insightful guidance for the interlaminar modification of Ti3C2Tx MXene to accommodate high operating voltage electrolyte with large-sized ions to obtain high-performance MSCs.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\n\\nThe challenges of solid-state supercapacitors (SCs) for flexible and wearable electronics still remain in well balancing the electrochemical performance, mechanical stability, and processing technologies. Herein, a high-performance, tailorable and foldable solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor is developed via one-step scalable chemical oxidization and MXene ink painting of N-doped carbon fiber textile (NCFT) substrate. The employed O/N-functionalized NCFT (ONCFT) and MXene materials under opposite potentials both incorporate excellent electrochemical behaviors of carbon-like materials and pseudocapacitive materials, namely high rate capability and pseudocapacitance. By regulating oxidization time and MXene loading, the active layer of MXene decorated NCFT (MNCFT) and ONCFT electrodes analogously present tight skin structure, fundamentally avoiding the risk of active materials detaching from the support during mechanical deformation. As a result, the assembled MNCFT//ONCFT device not only achieves an extended voltage window of 1.6\\xa0V, high areal energy density of 277.3 μWh cm−2 and 90% capacitance retention after 30\\u202f000 cycles, but also experiences repeated folding tests. Additionally, the design makes it possible to tailor the textile-based energy storage device (TEESD) into a designed size or shape without impairing its performance for device integration or shape conformable integration. Owing to the whole component fabrication being simple and scalable, the TEESD shows potential practical application.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\n\\nStretchable energy storage devices have become indispensable components toward energy autonomy for wearable electronic, implantable medical devices, and untethered soft machines. A Zn-based battery with a neutral electrolyte could act as a competitive candidate for wearable/implantable electronics because of its intrinsic safety and high energy density. Therefore, it is highly desired to develop a synergistic combination of stretchable anodes/cathodes and neutral electrolytes for stretchable Zn-based batteries. Herein, a scalable fabrication process is developed to produce stretchable Zn-ion hybrid batteries composed of V2CTx MXene cathodes and zinc-decorated Ti3C2Tx MXene anodes. To endow high stretchability to the Zn-ion hybrid battery, both MXene-based electrodes are fabricated with crumple-like microtextures enabling reversible folding/unfolding behaviors to attenuate in-plane stress while stretching. In comparison with the state-of-the-art work, the as-fabricated Zn-ion hybrid battery features large deformability (50% strain), ultrathin device (≈170\\xa0µm), low areal weight (≈20\\xa0mg cm−2), and an ultralow self-discharge rate (0.7\\xa0mV h−1), and demonstrates rechargeable and strain-insensitive specific capacities of 118.5 and 103.6 mAh g−1 under 0% and 50% strains, respectively. Finally, with ultrathin and lightweight merits, the stretchable battery is further fabricated into a magnetically actuated soft robot with remote control, capable of crawling between two designated points for charging/discharging tasks.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\nMXene (Ti3C2Tx) film is an extremely important macroscopic assembly of 2D MXene nanosheets, which has shown great commercial value in many fields. However, it is difficult to realize complex multi-scale structures design directly using MXene film as the base material. Herein, we discovered the self-welding phenomenon (time-sensitive) of MXene film based on water assistance. The MXene film can be connected freely during the time-sensitive period, but does not have self-weldability outside the time-effective period, ensuring the practicability of the connecting materials. Using the characteristics, the MXene film is successfully connected into a complex structure of humidity-responsive actuator and rolled into a vertically arranged dense electrode with capacitance independent of thickness. This work indicates that the MXene film has the same potential as metal and other engineering materials in the future, which is a milestone in the promotion of such conductive 2D material to real practical applications.',\n",

This study involved the synthesis and utilization of covalently crosslinked MXene/cellulose acetate mixed matrix membranes with MXene at different concentrations (CCAM-0% to CCAM-12%) for water purification applications. The membranes’ water flux, dye, and protein rejection performances were compared using dead-end (DE) and crossflow (CF) filtration. The fabricated membranes, especially CCAM-10%, exhibited high hydrophilicity, good surface roughness, significantly high water flux, high water uptake, and high porosity. A significantly higher flux was observed in CF filtration relative to DE filtration. Moreover, in CF filtration, the CCAM-10% membrane exhibited 96.60% and 99.49% rejection of methyl green (MG) and bovine serum albumin (BSA), respectively, while maintaining a flux recovery ratio of 67.30% and an irreversible fouling ratio at (Rir) of 32.70, indicating good antifouling performance. Hence, this study suggests that covalent modification of cellulose acetate membranes with MXene significantly improves the performance and fouling resistance of membranes for water filtration in CF mode relative to DE mode.',\n",

Through this process, substitution, and/or doping of phosphorous occurs at the basal plane with controllable chemical compositions (3.83–4.84 at%).

A unique combination of their metallic conductivity, hydrophilic surface, and excellent mechanical properties renders them attractive for transparent conductive electrode application. Here, a simple, scalable method is proposed to fabricate transparent conductive thin films using delaminated Ti3C2 MXene flakes by spray coating. Homogenous films, 5–70 nm thick, are produced at ambient conditions over a large area as shown by scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. The sheet resistances (Rs) range from 0.5 to 8 kΩ sq−1 at 40% to 90% transmittance, respectively, which corresponds to figures of merit (the ratio of electronic to optical conductivities, σDC/σopt) around 0.5–0.7. Flexible, transparent, and conductive films are also produced and exhibit stable Rs values at up to 5 mm bend radii. Furthermore, the films' optoelectronic properties are tuned by chemical or electrochemical intercalation of cations. The films show reversible changes of transmittance in the UV–visible region during electrochemical intercalation/deintercalation of tetramethylammonium hydroxide. This work shows the potential of MXenes to be used as transparent conductors in electronic, electrochromic, and sensor applications.\",\n",

The proliferation of wireless devices transmitting near the human body also raises interference and safety concerns that demand stretchable materials capable of shielding electromagnetic interference (EMI). Here, an ultrastretchable conductor is fabricated by depositing a crumple-textured coating composed of 2D Ti3C2Tx nanosheets (MXene) and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) onto latex, which can be fashioned into high-performance wearable antennas and EMI shields. The resulting MXene-SWNT (S-MXene)/latex devices are able to sustain up to an 800% areal strain and exhibit strain-insensitive resistance profiles during a 500-cycle fatigue test. A single layer of stretchable S-MXene conductors demonstrate a strain-invariant EMI shielding performance of ≈30 dB up to 800% areal strain, and the shielding performance is further improved to ≈47 and ≈52 dB by stacking 5 and 10 layers of S-MXene conductors, respectively. Additionally, a stretchable S-MXene dipole antenna is fabricated, which can be uniaxially stretched to 150% with unaffected reflected power <0.1%. By integrating S-MXene EMI shields with stretchable S-MXene antennas, a wearable wireless system is finally demonstrated that provides mechanically stable wireless transmission while attenuating EM absorption by the human body.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'AbstractThe conversion of highly toxic heavy metal hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) in the natural environment into low-toxic trivalent chromium (Cr(III)) is one of the research topics of great concern. Herein, a binary noble-metal-free photocatalyst consisting of ultrathin MXene (Ti3C2) and indium sulfide (In2S3) is prepared for ultrafast photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) under visible light. A simple electrostatic assembly and reflow method uniformly coats the In2S3 nanoflakes on the surface of hollow Ti3C2 nanospheres, which effectively boost the separation of charges and thus enhance the photocatalytic performance. Thus, the prepared heterojunction can reduce Cr(VI) to Cr(III) completely within 6 min with an ultrafast rate constant of k = 0.739 min−1. More importantly, the appropriate band structure ensures the stable existence of Cr(III). Therefore, it provides a new insight for economic MXene-based binary photocatalysts for efficient environmental remediation.Graphical abstractDownload : Download high-res image (134KB)Download : Download full-size image',\n",

To achieve this ambitious goal, it is imperative for electronics to be wearable, environmentally sustainable, and safe. However, large-scale manufacture of self-sufficient electronic systems by exploiting multifunctional materials still faces significant hurdles. Herein, multitasking aqueous printable MXene inks are reported as an additive-free high-capacitance electrode, sensitive pressure-sensing material, highly conducting current collector, metal-free interconnector, and conductive binder. By directly screen printing MXene inks, MXene-based micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) and lithium-ion microbatteries (LIMBs) are delicately fabricated on various substrates. The as-prepared MSCs exhibit ultrahigh areal capacitance of 1.1 F cm−2 and the serially connected MSCs offer a record voltage of 60\\xa0V. The quasi-solid-state LIMBs deliver a robust areal energy density of 154\\xa0μWh\\xa0cm−2. Furthermore, an all-flexible self-powered integrated system on a single substrate based on the multitasking MXene inks is demonstrated through seamless integration of a tandem solar cell, the LIMB, and an MXene hydrogel pressure sensor. Notably, this integrated system is exceptionally sensitive to body movements with a fast response time of 35\\xa0ms.

However, it has been a challenge to integrate 2D materials into ceramic matrices due to interdiffusion and chemical reactions at high temperatures. A recently reported sintering technique, the cold sintering process (CSP), which densifies ceramics with the assistance of transient aqueous solutions, provides a means to circumvent the aforementioned problems. The efficacious co-sintering of Ti3C2Tx (MXene), a 2D transition carbide, with ZnO, an oxide matrix, is reported. Using CSP, the ZnO–Ti3C2Tx nanocomposites can be sintered to 92–98% of the theoretical density at 300 °C, while avoiding oxidation or interdiffusion and showing homogeneous distribution of the 2D materials along the ZnO grain boundaries. The electrical conductivity is improved by 1–2 orders of magnitude due to the addition of up to 5 wt% MXene. The hardness and elastic modulus show an increase of 40–50% with 0.5 wt% MXene, and over 150% with 5 wt% of MXene. The successful densification of ZnO–MXene nanocomposite demonstrates that the cold sintering of ceramics with 2D materials is a promising processing route for designing new nanocomposites with a diverse range of applications.',\n",

However, the synergistic interaction between conductive filaments and active nanomaterials remains a crucial challenge, especially when hydrothermal or electrochemical deposition is used to produce a core (fiber)–shell (active materials) fibrous structure. On the other hand, although 2D pseudocapacitive materials, e.g., Ti3C2T\\nx\\n (MXene), have demonstrated high volumetric capacitance, high electrical conductivity, and hydrophilic characteristics, MXene-based electrodes normally suffer from poor rate capability owing to the sheet restacking especially when the loading level is high and solid-state gel is used as electrolyte.

Herein, MXene sensing layer is deposited on the surface of springlike helical core-sheath polyester yarns thanks to the capillarity effect and its intrinsic hydrophilic ability, and the resultant strain sensor and humidity sensor exhibit wide detection range from 0.3 to 120% strain and 30–100% relative humidity (RH) detection, owing to elastic core-sheath structures. The strain sensor shows excellent reproducibility (over 10000 cycles) and fast response time (120\\xa0ms). The core-sheath yarn sensor can detect various human motions such as walking, bending and twisting as well as physiological signal (pulse), which have great potential in real-time precise medicine and health care. The yarn sensor could also be an excellent humidity sensor because of the high specific area structure of yarn and intrinsic hydrophilic properties of MXene sensing layer.',\n",

For the first time, the flame retardancy of PVA/MXene nanocomposite was investigated using a microscale combustion calorimeter. The peak heat release rate (PHRR) and total heat release of the PVA composite were reduced by 25.7% and 25.5%, respectively, with 1 wt% of MXene. The temperatures at PHRR of PVA/MXene composites were improved with the addition of MXene. Moreover, the addition of MXene resulted in PVA composites with a higher tensile strength and elongation at break than those of a pure PVA film.

Herein, we reported a kind of self-healing microsupercapacitors (MSCs) based on size-dependent Ti3C2Tx MXene. Due to the rich physicochemical properties of Ti3C2Tx, the MSCs were fabricated by firstly spraying different lateral size MXene nanosheets onto the cellulose paper, and then selectively engraving interdigital electrodes by laser engraving machine. The flexible MXene-based MSCs were assembled by sulfuric acid-polyvinyl alcohol electrolyte. It is observed the electrochemical performance of MXene-based MSCs is significantly affected by the nanosheet size. And the capacitance of MSCs fabricated by smaller lateral nanosheet reached up to 73.6\\u2005mF/cm2, which is higher than that of the larger lateral nanosheet and mixture one that contains smaller and larger nanosheets (1\\u2009:\\u20091 mass ratio).

However, conventional charge storage through ion intercalation or double-layer formation cannot satisfy the requirements of such applications owing to the slow kinetics of ion intercalation and the small capacitance of the double layer. The present work demonstrates that the pseudocapacitance of the nanosheet compound MXene Ti2C achieves a higher specific capacity relative to double-layer capacitor electrodes and a higher rate capability relative to ion intercalation electrodes. By utilizing the pseudocapacitance as a negative electrode, the prototype Na-ion full cell consisting of an alluaudite Na2Fe2(SO4)3 positive electrode and an MXene Ti2C negative electrode operates at a relatively high voltage of 2.4\\u2009V and delivers 90 and 40\\u2009mAh\\u2009g−1 at 1.0 and 5.0\\u2009A\\u2009g−1 (based on the weight of the negative electrode), respectively, which are not attainable by conventional electrochemical energy storage systems.

They are also excellent electrical conductors with metal-like carrier concentrations. Herein, these characteristics are exploited to replace gold (Au) in GaAs photodetectors. By simply spin-coating transparent Ti3C2-based MXene electrodes from aqueous suspensions onto GaAs patterned with a photoresist and lifted off with acetone, photodetectors that outperform more standard Au electrodes are fabricated. Both the Au- and MXene-based devices show rectifying contacts with comparable Schottky barrier heights and internal electric fields. The latter, however, exhibit significantly higher responsivities and quantum efficiencies, with similar dark currents, hence showing better dynamic range and detectivity, and similar sub-nanosecond response speeds compared to the Au-based devices. The simple fabrication process is readily integratable into microelectronic, photonic-integrated circuits and silicon photonics processes, with a wide range of applications from optical sensing to light detection and ranging and telecommunications.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'MXenes are a novel class of two-dimensional (2D) materials whose applications in energy-storage systems have attracted substantial attention. Still, the rate performance of these materials is often diminished by sheet restacking, which is attenuated via controlled etching in ${\\\\mathrm{H}}_{2}{\\\\mathrm{SO}}_{4}$ solution. With this process, micropores are formed in MXene sheets that allow transport across 2D layers. As a result, the intercalation and diffusivity of ions are facilitated resulting in improved capacitance retention at high charge-discharge rates. In the present work, we used quasielastic neutron scattering to evaluate the potential changes in water dynamics as a consequence of this mechanism by assessing the behavior of weakly and strongly confined water populations in pristine and porous MXenes. First, we have found that the porous sample accommodates a noticeably higher content of both water populations. Additionally, the fraction of mobile molecules is higher either under strong or weak confinement. Interestingly, regardless of the abundance of weakly confined water in the porous sample, no considerable changes in the dynamical behavior were detected in comparison with the dynamics measured in the pristine material. For the strongly confined populations of water, our results show that water is able to permeate the micropores introduced by etching and perform unlocalized motions.',\n",

However, people often pay close attention to the versatility of MXene while ignoring its low exfoliation yield. In this work, a simplified and effective strategy to exfoliate multilayer-MXene via the gentle water freezing-and-thawing (FAT) approach is proposed. The volume expansion of intercalated water can promote the exfoliation of MXene nanosheets. The yield of large FAT-MXene flakes with special wrinkles can reach 39% after four cycles of the FAT process. Moreover, combining with sonication treatment can boost the yield of small MXene to a record high value of 81.4%. With the help of a commercial interdigital mask, an on-chip all-MXene micro-supercapacitor (MSC) assembled by large FAT-MXene is fabricated, exhibiting high areal and volumetric capacitance of 23.6 mF cm−2 and 591 F cm−3, respectively. This remarkable electrochemical performance of MXene-MSC also confirms the high quality of MXene through this FAT strategy. This study may open up a new method to simultaneously boost the yield of MXene with small or large flake sizes, facilitating large-scale and size-dependent research on MXene.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In this work, we apply an amine-assisted silica pillaring method to create the first example of a porous Mo2TiC2 MXene with nanoengineered interlayer distances. The pillared Mo2TiC2 has a surface area of 202 m2 g-1, which is among the highest reported for any MXene, and has a variable gallery height between 0.7 and 3 nm. The expanded interlayer distance leads to significantly enhanced cycling performance for Li-ion storage, with superior capacities, rate capabilities and cycling stabilities in comparison to the non-pillared version. The pillared Mo2TiC2 achieved capacities over 1.7 times greater than multilayered MXene at 20 mA g-1 (≈ 320 mAh g-1) and 2.5 times higher at 1 A g-1 (≈ 150 mAh g-1). The fast-charging properties of pillared Mo2TiC2 are further demonstrated by outstanding stability even at 1 A g-1 (under 8 min charge time), retaining 80% of the initial capacity after 500 cycles. Furthermore, we use a combination of spectroscopic techniques (i.e. XPS, NMR and Raman) to show unambiguously that the charge storage mechanism of this MXene occurs by a conversion reaction through the formation of Li2O. This reaction increases by 2-fold the capacity beyond intercalation, and therefore, its understanding is crucial for further development of this family of materials. In addition, we also investigate for the first time the sodium storage properties of the pillared and non-pillared Mo2TiC2.',\n",

To meet this requirement, up until now, numerous nanomaterials have been introduced to develop biosensors for achieving high sensitivity and selectivity.

MXenes are two-dimensional inorganic compounds with few atomic layers that possess excellent characteristics including high conductivity and superior fluorescent, optical, and plasmonic properties.

In normal cases, light-weight carbonaceous materials harnessing excellent electrical conductivity have served as electrode candidates. However, they struggle with undermined areal and volumetric energy density of supercapacitor devices, thereby greatly impeding the practical applications. Herein, we demonstrate the in situ coupling of NiCoP bimetallic phosphide and Ti3C2 MXene to build up heavy NCPM electrodes affording tunable mass loading throughout 3D printing technology. The resolution of prints reaches 50\\xa0μm and the thickness of device electrodes is ca. 4\\xa0mm. Thus-printed electrode possessing robust open framework synergizes favorable capacitance of NiCoP and excellent conductivity of MXene, readily achieving a high areal and volumetric capacitance of 20 F cm−2 and 137 F cm−3 even at a high mass loading of\\u2009~\\u200946.3\\xa0mg\\xa0cm−2. Accordingly, an asymmetric supercapacitor full cell assembled with 3D-printed NCPM as a positive electrode and 3D-printed activated carbon as a negative electrode harvests remarkable areal and volumetric energy density of 0.89 mWh cm−2 and 2.2 mWh cm−3, outperforming the most of state-of-the-art carbon-based supercapacitors. The present work is anticipated to offer a viable solution toward the customized construction of multifunctional architectures via 3D printing for high-energy-density energy storage systems.',\n",

Here, the optoelectronic and pseudocapacitive properties of titanium carbide (Ti3C2Tx) are combined to create a MXene electrochromic device, with a visible absorption peak shift from 770 to 670 nm and a 12% reversible change in transmittance with a switching rate of <1 s when cycled in an acidic electrolyte under applied potentials of less than 1 V. By probing the electrochromic effect in different electrolytes, it is shown that acidic electrolytes (H3PO4 and H2SO4) lead to larger absorption peak shifts and a higher change of transmittance than the neutral electrolyte (MgSO4) (Δλ is 100 nm vs 35 nm and ΔT770 nm is ≈12% vs ≈3%, respectively), hinting at the surface redox mechanism involved. Further investigation of the mechanism by in situ X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy reveals that the reversible shift of the absorption peak is attributed to protonation/deprotonation of oxide-like surface functionalities. As a proof of concept, it is shown that Ti3C2Tx MXene, dip-coated on a glass substrate, functions as both transparent conductive coating and active material in an electrochromic device, opening avenues for further research into optoelectronic and photonic applications of MXenes.',\n",

Despite tremendous efforts devoted to photonic tumor hyperthermia, current photothermal-conversion nanoagents still suffer from critical issues preventing further clinical translation such as low biodegradability. Here, for the first time, the construction of novel 2D molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) MXenes for photonic tumor hyperthermia is reported. The structure of both bulk Mo2Ga2C ceramic and Mo2C MXene is fully revealed. Especially, computational simulation, as a novel strategy and a powerful tool for photonic-performance prediction, is employed to reveal that Mo2C MXene is featured with intense near-infrared (NIR) absorption, covering the first and the second biological transparency window (NIR I and II). After further surface engineering with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), Mo2C-PVA nanoflakes exhibit high biocompatibility and fast degradability. Importantly, it is experimentally corroborated that Mo2C-PVA nanoflakes possess intriguing broad absorption band spanning NIR in both the I and II regions, and desirable photothermal-conversion efficiency (24.5% for NIR I and 43.3% for NIR II). This study not only broadens the nanomedical applications of MXene by fabricating novel material members (Mo2C), but also provides the paradigm of inorganic multifunctional biomedical nanoplatform with desirable biodegradability and high therapeutic performance.',\n",

However, a few routes for surface tailoring are explored and little is known about the extent to which the terminating species can saturate the MXene surfaces. Among available terminations, atomic oxygen is of interest for electrochemical energy storage, hydrogen evolution reaction, photocatalysis, etc. However, controlled oxidation of the surfaces is not trivial due to the favored formation of oxides. In the present contribution, single sheets of Ti3C2Tx MXene, inherently terminated by F and O, are defluorinated by heating in vacuum and subsequentially exposed to O2 gas at temperatures up to 450 °C in situ, in an environmental transmission electron microscope. Results include exclusive termination by O on the MXene surfaces and eventual supersaturation (x > 2) with a retained MXene sheet structure. Upon extended O exposure, the MXene structure transforms into TiO2 and desorbs surface bound H2O and CO2 reaction products. These results are fundamental for understanding the oxidation, the presence of water on MXene surfaces, and the degradation of MXenes, and pave way for further tailoring of MXene surfaces.',\n",

MXene Ti3C2 obtained by treating Ti3AlC2 precursor and ultrasonic intercalation is composed of one or several layers of Ti3C2, which is known as few-layered Ti3C2. Due to the strong force between the layers of Ti3C2, it is easy to stack in the long charge–discharge cycle, and it is difficult to embed load ions, resulting in capacitance attenuation. This work proposed a delamination method of multilayer Ti3C2 using microwave-assisted etching and obtained few-layered Ti3C2 as a result. As traditional centrifuge involves a lot of mechanical agitation and centrifuging, an efficient delamination is a good contribution to the field.

Accordingly, the electrical conductivity increases from 3.94\\xa0S\\xa0cm−1 for PEA-derived neat CNF to 15.74\\xa0S\\xa0cm−1 for HCNF10 (10 dip-coating cycles) due to the increase in the content of electrically conductive MXene nanosheets.

However, the low potential window (ΔV\\xa0≈ 0.6\\xa0V) of MXene e.g., Ti3C2Tx limits the energy density of the SCs. Herein, asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) are fabricated by assembling the exfoliated Ti3C2Tx (Ex-Ti3C2Tx) as the negative electrode and transition metal chalcogenide (MoS3−x) coated 3D-printed nanocarbon framework (MoS3−x@3DnCF) as the positive electrode utilizing polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/H2SO4 gel electrolyte, which provides a wide ΔV of 1.6\\xa0V. The Ex-Ti3C2Tx possesses wrinkled sheets which prevent the restacking of Ti3C2Tx 2D layers. The MoS3−x@3DnCF holds a porous structure and offers diffusion-controlled intercalated pseudocapacitance that enhances the overall capacitance. The 3D printing allows a facile fabrication of customized shaped MoS3−x@3DnCF electrodes. Employing the advantages of the 3D-printing facilities, two different ASCs, such as sandwich- and interdigitated-configurations are fabricated. The customized ASCs provide excellent capacitive performance. Such ASCs combining the MXene and electroactive 3D-printed nanocarbon framework can be used as potential energy storage devices in modern electronics.',\n",

The results show a strong dependence of the electrode deformation on cation size and charge.

       "  'abstract': 'Two-dimensional transition-metal carbide MXenes has been known as a promising material of high-performance electrode for energy storage applications with both non-aqueous and aqueous electrolytes because it has electronic conductivity, ion capability in interlayer nanospace, and the redox activity of Ti. Especially, as an electrode of electrochemical capacitors, MXenes have a unique dependence of capacitance on intercalated cation species and a distinctive behavior that is both capacitive and pseudocapacitive depending on the electrolyte. To better understand electrochemical mechanism of these behaviors, we performed a microscopic theoretical analysis of the electric-double layer (EDL) in the interlayer nanospace of the MXene electrode by combining first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) and classical implicit solvation theory named three dimensional reference-site interaction model (3D-RISM) method [1]. By using the quantum-classical hybrid simulation, solvation effect at the interlayer nanospace of MXene electrode was taken into consideration appropriately with low computational cost comparable with conventional DFT simulation.\\n               For the unique dependence of capacitance on intercalated cation species, our simulation results showed that the capacitance of EDL capacitors can be enhanced by a factor of 1.8, when the water molecules are strongly confined into the two-dimensional nanoslits of titanium carbide MXene electrode. This is because that dipolar polarization of strongly confined water overscreens an external electric field applied on the EDL and enhances capacitance with a characteristically negative dielectric constant of a water molecule [2, 3].\\n                Another investigated feature is the distinctive behavior that is both capacitive and pseudocapacitive depending on the electrolyte. As a result of their electronic states simulated via the quantum-classical hybrid simulation, it was found that the hydration shell of intercalated ions prevents orbital coupling between MXene and the intercalated ions, which leads to the formation of an EDL and capacitive behavior. However, once the cations are partially dehydrated and adsorbed onto the MXene surface directly, because of orbital coupling of the cation states with the MXene states, particularly for surface-termination groups, charge transfer occurs and results in a pseudocapacitive behavior [4].\\n               References\\n               [1] S.

In this work, bimetallic CoFe-MOF@Ti3C2Tx MXene derived multiple-interfacial composites with controllable structures were prepared via solvothermal, electrostatic self-assembly and thermal treatment. The morphology conversion, phase compositions, defects quantity were achieved by the thermal treatment temperature. The synthesized core-shelled CoFe/C@TiO2/C composite exhibits excellent microwave absorption properties. The minimum reflection loss values at different absorber thicknesses can reach −20\\xa0dB within 1.6–5.0\\xa0mm and the effective absorption bandwidth can reach 6.1\\xa0GHz with an absorber thickness of only 2.0\\xa0mm. The corresponding electric loss, magnetic loss and impedance matching have also been studied to explore the electromagnetic wave attenuation mechanisms. This work lays a good foundation of MOF and MXene composites derivatives as microwave absorber and opens up a way for the design of the high-performance Microwave absorbing materials.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) is a coenzyme and acts as a redox cofactor in metabolic process. Owing to such problems as poor electron transfer properties, unfavorable adsorption, and lack of stability on rigid electrodes, the bio-electrochemical applications of FAD have been limited. Herein, a novel fabrication method was developed for the immobilization process using 2D MXene (Ti3C2Tx), which enhanced the redox property of FAD and improved the electro-catalytic reduction of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in neutral medium. The FAD-immobilized Ti3C2Tx electrode (FAD/Ti3C2Tx) was studied by UV-Visible and Raman spectroscopies, which confirmed the successful adsorption of FAD on the Ti3C2Tx surface. The surface morphology and the elemental composition of Ti3C2Tx were investigated by high resolution transmission electron microscopy and the energy dispersive X-ray analysis. The redox property of the FAD/Ti3C2Tx modified glassy carbon electrode (FAD/Ti3C2Tx/GCE) was highly dependent on pH and exhibited a stable redox peak at −0.455 V in neutral medium. Higher amounts of FAD molecules were loaded onto the 2D MXene (Ti3C2Tx)-modified electrode, which was two times higher than the values in the reported work, and the surface coverage (ᴦFAD) was 0.8 × 10−10 mol/cm2. The FAD/Ti3C2Tx modified sensor showed the electrocatalytic reduction of H2O2 at −0.47 V, which was 130 mV lower than the bare electrode. The FAD/Ti3C2Tx/GCE sensor showed a linear detection of H2O2 from 5 nM to 2 µM. The optimization of FAD deposition, amount of Ti3C2Tx loading, effect of pH and the interference study with common biochemicals such as glucose, lactose, dopamine (DA), potassium chloride (KCl), ascorbic acid (AA), amino acids, uric acid (UA), oxalic acid (OA), sodium chloride (NaCl) and acetaminophen (PA) have been carried out. The FAD/Ti3C2Tx/GCE showed high selectivity and reproducibility. Finally, the FAD/Ti3C2Tx modified electrode was successfully applied to detect H2O2 in ovarian cancer cell lines.',\n",

Here, we present transient all-MXene NO2 and pressure sensors employing three-dimensional porous crumpled MXene spheres prepared by ultrasonic spray pyrolysis technology as the sensing layer, accompanied with water-soluble polyvinyl alcohol substrates embedded with patterned MXene electrodes.

       "  'abstract': 'AbstractPolymer/conductor composite dielectrics easily have high permittivity, high conductivity, and high dielectric loss, limiting large increase of energy storage density in them. The relationship between high permittivity and low conductivity is coordinated to achieve high energy density. In this study, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/V2C MXene/cellulose ternary composites with high permittivity and low dielectric loss were prepared. Due to good water solubility of PVA and high water dispersibility of V2C, PVA and V2C have good interfacial compatibility. That reduces the interface electric leakage conductance, which is conducive to the lower conductivity and dielectric loss in the composite materials. The high interfacial polarization between PVA and V2C improves the dielectric response of the composite materials, improving the permittivity of the composite materials. Compared with binary PVA/V2C composites, ternary PVA/V2C/cellulose composite materials use the high insulation of cellulose filler to increase the insulation of composites. Thus, the conductivity and dielectric loss are reduced in ternary composites. Good synergy of conductive V2C and insulating cellulose fillers is important to obtaining the balance of high dielectric response and high insulation trait in ternary composites. Best ternary composite with 6 wt% V2C has a high permittivity of ca. 40, low dielectric loss of ca. 0.25 at 100 Hz, and high breakdown strength of ca. 40 MV m−1. This work enables a facile preparation of promising composites for dielectric energy storage.Relevance summary\\n• Novel ternary composite dielectric films with V\\n\\n2\\n\\nC MXene and cellulose were fabricated.\\n\\n• Good synergy of V\\n\\n2\\n\\nC and cellulose can lead to optimization of overall electric properties.\\n\\n• This work might provide ideas for preparing bio-dielectric materials employing cellulose.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\n\\nA facile and controllable strategy, which combines solvothermal treatment with ex situ nitrogen doping by using urea saturated alcohol solution or monoethanolamine as nitrogen source, is used to prepare flexible, freestanding, and compact nitrogen-doped delaminated Ti3C2 (abbreviated N-Ti3C2) film electrodes for symmetric electrochemical capacitors (ECs). Compared with the N sites from in situ N solid solution doping, those of ex situ N solvothermal doping enable larger contributions to the capacitance through regulating nitrogen species and content. As a result, the urea-assisted N-Ti3C2 (UN-Ti3C2) film exhibits an ultrahigh volumetric capacitance of 2836 F cm−3 (927 F g−1) at 5 mV s−1 in 3 m H2SO4 solution. This value surpasses the all previously reported volumetric performance of MXenes. A large capacitance of 2643 F cm−3 (786 F g−1) is also obtained for the monoethanolamine-assisted N-Ti3C2 film. In addition, the symmetric electrochemical capacitor fabricated from the binder-free UN-Ti3C2 film exhibits a high volumetric energy density of 76 Wh L−1, which is the highest value achieved compared to those of MXenes so far. This work presents the effects of nitrogen species and solvothermal treatment on the electrochemical performance of MXene, and opens up an exciting opportunity for fabricating highly flexible and integrated ECs.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Transition metal carbide nanosheets known as MXene possess electronic conductivity comparable to typical metallic materials.1 However, when fabricating MXene electrodes for electrochemical applications, due to the highly anisotropic nature of the nanosheet, MXene tends to re-stack and generally aligns horizontally with respect to the current collector. 2 Such electrodes suffer from low active surface area and slow kinetics owing to the poor diffusivity of the reactant. In this study, a vertically aligned MXene electrode is fabricated and used as a scaffold for electrochemical biosensing of allergenic protein in food. The vertically aligned MXene electrode can be anticipated to have enhanced electrolyte diffusivity transfer rate.\\n               The vertically aligned MXene electrode was prepared by adopting the method developed to prepare vertically aligned graphene electrode.3 MXene was electrophoretically deposited from to an aqueous MXene colloid and subjected freeze-drying, and transferred to the surface of a glassy carbon (GC) electrode. The surface of MXene was modified as follows (Fig. 1A). The vertically aligned MXene electrode was immersed in 1 mM 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) solution, followed by the modification with the cross-linking reagents, N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N’-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride and N-hydroxysuccinimide. The antibody (provided by Nippon Flour Mills Co., Ltd.) was immobilized on the MXene surface, and bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used to prevent non-specific adsorption of non-related proteins. Electrochemical measurements of the antibody-immobilized electrode before and after the reaction with the allergenic protein were performed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution containing 5 mM hexaaminerutenium (Ⅲ) chloride ([Ru(NH3)6]3+).\\n               The thickness of vertically aligned MXene film according to scanning electron microscopy images was about 300 μm, and the distance between the walls of nanosheets was about 20 μm (Fig. 1B). From the surface image in Fig. 1C, the average pore diameter was about 20 µm, which was in good agreement with the distance between the walls of nanosheets. Subsequently, the electrochemical characteristics of the vertically- and horizontally-aligned MXene electrodes modified with antibody were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (Fig. 1D). The vertically aligned electrode showed higher current density than horizontally-aligned electrode. In addition, a smaller difference between the oxidation potential and the reduction potential for the vertically aligned electrode. These results suggest an improvement in the diffusivity of the redox probe in the electrolyte.\\n               Acknowledgments\\n               We thank Prof. Yury Gogotsi and Dr. Babak Anasori (Drexel University) for providing MXene.\\n               References \\n                     \\n                        A.

Thus, highly efficient treatment technologies for wastewater are urgently needed. In this work, seven kinds of typical antibiotics (including water and alcohol soluble ones) are successfully separated from the corresponding aqueous and ethanolic solutions using highly regular laminated membranes. Our membranes are assembled with 2–4\\u2005μm titanium carbide nanosheets. The solvent permeance through such titanium carbide membrane is one order of magnitude higher than that through most polymeric nanofiltration membranes with similar antibiotics rejection. This high flux is due to the regular two-dimensional (2D) structure resulting from the large aspect ratio of titanium carbide nanosheets. Moreover, the electrostatic interaction between the surface terminations and the antibiotics also affects the rejection and enhances the antifouling property. Such 2D titanium carbide membranes further broaden the application scope of laminated materials for separation and purification of high value added drugs in academia and industry.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'AbstractZinc metal batteries have been considered as a promising candidate for next-generation batteries due to their high safety and low cost. However, their practical applications are severely hampered by the poor cyclability that caused by the undesired dendrite growth of metallic Zn. Herein, Ti3C2Tx MXene was first used as electrolyte additive to facilitate the uniform Zn deposition by controlling the nucleation and growth process of Zn. Such MXene additives can not only be absorbed on Zn foil to induce uniform initial Zn deposition via providing abundant zincophilic-O groups and subsequently participate in the formation of robust solid-electrolyte interface film, but also accelerate ion transportation by reducing the Zn2+ concentration gradient at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Consequently, MXene-containing electrolyte realizes dendrite-free Zn plating/striping with high Coulombic efficiency (99.7%) and superior reversibility (stably up to 1180 cycles). When applied in full cell, the Zn-V2O5 cell also delivers significantly improved cycling performances. This work provides a facile yet effective method for developing reversible zinc metal batteries.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\n\\nSupercapacitors attract great interest because of the increasing and urgent demand for environment-friendly high-power energy sources. Ti3C2, a member of MXene family, is a promising electrode material for supercapacitors owing to its excellent chemical and physical properties. However, the highest gravimetric capacitance of the MXene-based electrodes is still relatively low (245 F g−1) and the key challenge to improve this is to exploit more pseudocapacitance by increasing the active site concentration. Here, a method to significantly improve the gravimetric capacitance of Ti3C2Tx MXenes by cation intercalation and surface modification is reported. After K+ intercalation and terminal groups (OH−/F−) removing , the intercalation pseudocapacitance is three times higher than the pristine MXene, and MXene sheets exhibit a significant enhancement (about 211% of the origin) in the gravimetric capacitance (517 F g−1 at a discharge rate of 1 A g−1). Moreover, the as-prepared electrodes show above 99% retention over 10 000 cycles. This improved electrochemical performance is attributed to the large interlayer voids of Ti3C2 and lowest terminated surface group concentration. This study demonstrates a new strategy applicable to other MXenes (Ti2CTx, Nb2CTx, etc.) in maximizing their potential applications in energy storage.',\n",

Herein, an ultrathin S-scheme heterojunction g-C3N4/TiO2/C (SL-EAC) consisting of few-layer g-C3N4 nanosheets on monolayer Ti3C2Tx MXene converted TiO2/C is prepared through an electrostatic self-assembly and calcination method. The monolayer Ti3C2Tx can not only prevent g-C3N4 from agglomerating through forming close contact with g-C3N4, but its conversion to TiO2/C during calcination can build a bridge between the relatively inert TiO2 and multigroup-terminated Ti3C2Tx, which indirectly enhances the interface contact between TiO2/C and g-C3N4. SL-EAC with a thickness of around 5\\u2009nm shows much better photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance than g-C3N4, TiO2/C prepared by calcination of monolayer Ti3C2Tx and g-C3N4/TiO2/C (EAC) prepared by the same method but monolayer Ti3C2Tx is altered by multilayer Ti3C2Tx. The excellent performance of SL-EAC is attributed to the large contact area between g-C3N4 and TiO2/C, which is conducive to the S-scheme transfer of photogenerated charge carriers. Moreover, the samples prepared using different methods are also investigated, which further confirms the great contact area and strong interaction between the composites in ultrathin SL-EAC.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\n\\nThe capacitance of microsupercapacitors (MSCs) can double if both sides of substrates are used to construct MSCs. Nevertheless, achieving electric connections of MSCs through substrates is a challenge due to the difficulty in precisely positioning each MSC couple that has two of the same MSCs units on two sides. In this work, taking advantage of the synchronous etching on both sides of transparent polyethylene terephthalate substrates by femtosecond laser pulses, a double-sided configuration is attained with high precision in the alignment of back-to-back MSC couples and versatile double-side MSCs are realized via arbitrary on- and through-substrate connections of MXene MSC units. The MXene double-side MSC fabricated by the series connection of 12 spiral pattern MXene MSC units with interdigital electrodes of 10 μm width interspace can output a large working voltage of 7.2 V. Additionally, femtosecond laser etching brings the transformation of MXene into titania near-etched edges with a lateral distance less than 1 µm. Such a small laser-affected area has little influence on the capacitive performance, which is one of advantages for femtosecond laser over conventional lasers. This research is valuable for one-step manufacturing of highly integrated MSCs in the field of miniaturized energy storage systems.',\n",

However, the obvious light losses at the liquid−solid interfaces still limit its broad applications, thereby resulting in a poor light absorption ability. To this end, a facile and general approach is designed for the construction of nanoflower MXene@MoS2 with excellent photothermal conversion ability via one-step hydrothermal process. Thanks to the multireflective and synergestic effects between MXene and MoS2, the hierarchical MXene@MoS2 heterostructure exhibits broadband light absorption and improved photothermal conversion capacity (69\\u2009°C after 10\\u2009min solar illumination). Furthermore, inspired by the water vapor process in multiple channels of trees, an ultrathin MXene@MoS2-based nanofibrous membrane is assembled via directional electrospinning technology. Compared with traditional irregular channels, the controllable and tree-inspired 3D structure shows competitive advantages in solar absorption and water transport. Thus, the as-prepared self-floating membrane presents durable hydrophobicity (contact angle [CA]\\u2009=\\u2009125°) and a high evaporation rate of 1.39\\u2009kg/(m2h) (91% efficiency) under 1 sun, which is higher than reported. This 3D MXene-based device also shows promising electrical generation, solar-driven sewage, and desalination treatments (99% desalination efficiency). Such high-performance self-floating photothermal membranes with multifunctionalities might provide an effective strategy for solving the global problems of freshwater shortage.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In this study, the energy loss near edge structure (ELNES) of two-dimensional transition metal carbides and nitrides, namely ‘MXenes’, has been calculated in the density functional theory using the full-potential linearized augmented plane wave method. Calculations of band structure demonstrate that, in agreement with other studies, although MAX phases (bulks) and pristine MXenes (monolayers) are all metallic, some functionalized MXenes are semiconductors. For the first time, we have calculated the ELNES spectra of carbon and nitrogen K-edges in MAX M2AlX phases, pristine M2X MXenes and functionalized MXenes M2XT2 (M\\u2009=\\u2009Sc, Hf; X\\u2009=\\u2009C, N; T\\u2009=\\u2009F, OH, O) at magic angle conditions. Compared to the M2AlX bulks, the differences of energy between the main peaks in carbon and nitrogen K edges of M2X monolayers increase due to the slightly smaller bond lengths that can be used as a fingerprint for monolayers. The structures in ELNES spectra are sensitive to the chemical nature and the location of the T groups on the MXene surface. The energy position of the first main peak and the separation between the main peaks in the ELNES spectra of M2XT2 increase from T\\u2009=\\u2009O to T\\u2009=\\u2009OH and to T\\u2009=\\u2009F surface groups, respectivelyshows that the M-X bond length decreases from T\\u2009=\\u2009O to T\\u2009=\\u2009OH and to T\\u2009=\\u2009F. This short bond in M2XF2 leads to enhanced M-X interaction. The main features in carbon and nitrogen K edges correspond to the peaks in the unoccupied densities of states (DOS), namely σ* and π* states; however, the contribution of σ* states is dominant. Furthermore, for accurate insight into the excitonic effects (electron–hole coupling) in core edges, we have used the solving of the equation of motion of the two-particle Green’s function, the Bethe–Salpeter equation (BSE) to determine these effects on the K x-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) of semiconductors Sc2CF2, Sc2C(OH)2, Sc2CO2 and Hf2CO2 MXenes. Calculations have been performed in two different levels of theory, with and without considering the excitonic effects. The excitonic effects considerably result in shifting the spectral features to the lower energies and changing in the intensity and overall shapes of the absorption spectra.',\n",

Thus, a new strategy is urgently needed. In this study, a simple preparation method for Ti3C2 MXene colloidal solution is proposed. In vitro, Staphylococcus aureus is treated with 250\\xa0µg mL−1 of Ti3C2 colloidal solution under 5\\xa0min of 808\\xa0nm near-infrared (NIR) laser irradiation twice. Staphylococcus aureus is eliminated by the “nanothermal blade” effect from Ti3C2 combined with NIR; the antibacterial rate is 99%, which is higher than the antibacterial rate of pure Ti3C2 alone 78%. The antibacterial mechanism underlying this treatment may be that the thermal Ti3C2 nanosheets first transfer heat to the cell membrane, disrupting the membrane structure, disturbing the metabolism and causing leakage of bacterial protein and deoxyribonucleic acid, consequently leading to bacterial death. In vivo results indicate that Ti3C2 colloidal solution under NIR can effectively kill Staphylococcus aureus and prevent inflammation. Moreover, 250\\xa0µg mL−1 Ti3C2 colloidal solution is nontoxic to mouse organs during the therapeutic process. Therefore, Ti3C2 colloidal solution can be an ideal candidate for subcutaneous infection application.

It is noteworthy that the Ti3C2Tx showed some attractive features including unique 2D layered structures, large surface area, good hydrophilicity, and rich active recognition sites, endowing it has a high affinity towards the target polychlorinated biphenyls.

The synergy between these two bidimensional materials (Co-LDH and Ti3C2Tx), evidenced by coupling electron energy loss spectroscopy and density functional theory simulations, results in superior electrocatalytic properties and makes possible having an excellent and stable oxygen evolution electrocatalyst. Moreover, the oxidative-sensitive MXene structure is preserved during the synthesis of the composite and the formation of a well recovering Co-LDH phase avoids the irreversible oxidation of MXene at high potential values, which may affect its conductivity.

During the assembly of MXene nanosheets into MXene membrane, the ATP nanorods could insert into the stacked layers of MXene. The permeation flux and rejection rate of the composite membranes for MB solution were studied, and the working mechanism was analyzed. The MXene membrane was intercalated with ATP nanorods, which effectively increased the size of the nano-channel between layers, and the permeation flux of the MXene membrane was effectively improved. When the mass ration of MXene to ATP was 1:2, the composite membrane showed the best separation performances, such as the permeation flux of pure water increased by 97.31%. For MB solution, the permeation flux increased by 67.17%, and the rejection rate still reached 90.67%. The synergistic effect of size repulsion and electrostatic repulsion was observed during the MB separation. The highwater permeability and separation efficiency of MXene/ATP composite membranes may also enlighten the great prospects of MXene-based nanostructured materials in the dye wastewater treatment.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\n\\n\\nAs a 2D material, Ti3C2 (MXene) has been recently used as electrodes for electrochemical capacitors. Herein, a two-step procedure is used to obtain a highly opened layer structure for Ti3C2, which differs from the methods used in the literature for synthesizing exfoliated MXene. First, the mild NH4HF2 etching agent is used to prepare the regular Ti3C2 MXene. Second, KOH is added into the obtained solution for K+ to intercalate the MXene. The K+ intercalation is found to greatly increase the (002) crystal planar spacing of the Ti3C2 from 10.8 to 12.4\\u2009Å. More importantly, this K+-intercalated MXene exhibits a highly opened layer structure, whereas the regular MXene only has a partially opened layer structure. Consequently, the former is expected to allow much more active sites exposed to liquid electrolyte, and also facilitates remarkably higher ion and electron transport efficiency. To investigate their electrochemical capacitance properties, the regular and K+-intercalated Ti3C2 MXenes are used to fabricate binder-free electrodes on nickel foams by an electrophoretic deposition method. The K+-intercalated MXene-based electrode is found to have twice higher specific capacitance than the regular MXene. Furthermore, the K+-intercalated Ti3C2 MXene-based electrode exhibits an excellent cyclic stability.',\n",

Although monolayered Ti2NTx MXene has been expected to have biological activity, experimental studies revealed significant difficulties due to obstacles to its synthesis, its low stability and its susceptibility to oxidation and decomposition.\\n              \\n              \\n                Results\\n                In this paper, we report our theoretical calculations showing the higher likelihood of forming multilayered Ti2NTx structures during the preparation process in comparison to single-layered structures. As a result of our experimental work, we successfully synthesized multilayered Ti2NTx MXene that was suitable for biological studies by the etching of the Ti2AlN MAX phase and further delamination. The biocompatibility of Ti2NTx MXene was evaluated in vitro towards human skin malignant melanoma cells, human immortalized keratinocytes, human breast cancer cells, and normal human mammary epithelial cells. Additionally, the potential mode of action of 2D Ti2NTx was investigated using reactive oxygen tests as well as SEM observations. Our results indicated that multilayered 2D sheets of Ti2NTx showed higher toxicity towards cancerous cell lines in comparison to normal ones. The decrease in cell viabilities was dose-dependent. The generation of reactive oxygen species as well as the internalization of the 2D sheets play a decisive role in the mechanisms of toxicity.\\n              \\n              \\n                Conclusions\\n                We have shown that 2D Ti2NTx in the form of multilayered nanoflakes exhibits fair stability and can be used for in vitro studies.

Interfacial solar steam generator is emerging as a sustainable system for water harvesting under natural solar irradiance. However, natural sunlight is usually insufficient for conventional interfacial (2D absorber) solar steam generators to achieve high solar steam efficiency (>85%). Herein, a functionalized MXene-polymeric membrane-based solar steam generator in a heat localization structure is reported as an efficient water harvesting and desalination system. The functionalized MXene flakes are homogeneously dispersed and encapsulated in polymeric networks of cellulose acetate in the crosslinking process, where water is automatically pumped through the absorber in the embedded nano/micro channels. As such, the fabricated solar steam generator shows a net evaporation rate (with respect to that in the dark condition) of 1.47\\xa0kg\\xa0m−2\\xa0h−1 with 92.1% efficiency under 1 sun illumination. Moreover, the salt rejection rate for high salinity seawater (original Na+ concentration is 18\\xa0000\\xa0mg\\xa0L−1) reaches up to 97.5%, generating drinkable water that meets the WHO standard. The new photothermal membrane absorber is cost-effective, scalable, washable, and stable under harsh conditions; holding great promise for practical solar desalination applications.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Small scale energy storage devices are expected to play a significant role in the future advances of portable electronics, wireless sensors, and multifunctional micro/nanosystems. A crucial requirement for the fabrication of energy storage devices with high energy and power densities is using electrode materials with superior electrochemical properties. Another important requirement is the assembly of the electrode materials into structures that promote high ionic and electronic conductivities. In this talk, we report a scalable printing method for fabrication of on-chip three-dimensional (3D) micro-supercapacitors based on a class of 2D transition metal carbides called MXenes as electrode materials. MXenes offer high electronic conductivity and high specific capacitance and therefore, have attracted much interest as high-performance electrode materials for supercapacitors. In our work, the fabrication of MXene electrodes and device assembly is achieved using an extrusion-based 3D printing process that uses viscoelastic water-based MXene ink. A programmable printing machine was used in the printing process which involved layer-by-layer deposition of the MXene ink to fabricate the 3D electrodes. The developed printing method allows rapid fabrication of micro-supercapacitors on a variety of substrates, while electrode height can be controlled by the number of deposited layers. All-solid-state devices printed on flexible substrates showed excellent electrochemical performances under different bending conditions and delivered extremely high areal capacitances (over 1035 mF cm-2). Our study suggests that due to its high electronic conductivity and electrochemical properties, MXene is an excellent electrode material for the fabrication of 3D energy storage devices',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Rechargeable aluminum batteries that utilize aluminum metal as the anode are one of the most promising alternative energy storage systems for current Li-ion batteries that suffer from flammability, safety issues, high cost, and limited lithium resources. Aluminum is the most abundant metal in Earth’s crust, offers three-electron redox reactions in electrochemical systems, and has the highest theoretical volumetric capacity of 8040 mAh cm-3 among all metals and reasonably high theoretical gravimetric capacity of 2980 mAh g-1. Also, aluminum metal can be handled in the open air; thus, aluminum batteries benefit from high safety and facile cell fabrication and operation compared to lithium and sodium battery systems [1]. However, development of these battery systems is mostly hindered by a lack of cathode materials that can host aluminum cations and offer high capacities and insertion potentials. \\n               In this presentation, we show reversible intercalation of aluminum in two-dimensional (2D) vanadium carbides (V2C), a member of MXene family of materials, as a potential high-performance cathode material for rechargeable aluminum batteries. MXenes with a general formula of Mn+1Xn (n=1,2, and 3, M is a transition metal, and X is carbon and/or nitrogen) are a family of 2D transition metal carbides and/or carbonitrides that are produced by selective etching of the A layer elements (i.e. Al) from MAX phases (i.e. V2AlC), a large group of layered ternary carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides [2-4]. The Aluminum battery cells incorporating V2C MXene as cathode operates by electrochemical deposition and dissolution of aluminum at the anode and intercalation/de-intercalation of Al3+ ions in between the layers of 2D nanosheets of MXene cathode. Our study shows that through a careful and proper fabrication of electrode structure, V2C cathodes can deliver reversible capacities more than ~ 200 mAh g-1 at a high charge and discharge rate of 100 mA g-1, comparable to current cathode materials for lithium and sodium-ion batteries. V2C cathode exhibits a high Coulombic efficiency of above 95% and delivers a good rate capability in a 1.7 V potential window. We also show that change in the oxidation state of the transition metal in the MXene structure plays an important role in charge storage mechanism of MXenes as cathode materials for Aluminum batteries. \\n               \\xa0\\n               \\n                  Keywords: 2D, Vanadium carbide, MXenes, Aluminum battery \\n               \\n                  \\xa0\\n               \\n               \\n                  References\\n               \\n               1.

       "  'abstract': 'Two-dimensional (2D) materials, such as graphene, are attractive candidates for energy storage devices due to their large areas of electrochemically-active surfaces. Recently, MXenes, a new family of 2D carbides discovered at Drexel University in 2011, have shown promise for electrodes in Lithium-ion batteries and supercapacitors. The goal of this study was to determine if a combination of MXenes, which have high metallic conductivity but moderate capacity, and transition metal oxides (TMOs) with high lithium storage capacity but poor conductivity may result in improved performance. \\n               Three different methods, including alternating filtration, spray coating, and in-situ growth, were employed to achieve the hybridization of Ti3C2 MXenes and TMOs. Flexible and free-standing Ti3C2/TMO papers were obtained. In these composites, the 1-nm thin flakes of Ti3C2-MXene provide superior conductivity, ensure mechanical integrity and flexibility, as well as some Li-ion storage capacity; the TMOs (e.g. Co3O4, NiCo2O4) nanosheets/nanorods serve as spacers between MXene flakes to improve the accessibility of electrolyte ions and provide additional capacity. The synergetic effect of the two materials leads to much improved performance compared to pure Ti3C2 or TMOs. The Ti3C2/TMO paper electrodes containing alternation layers of carbide and oxide achieved high reversible capacities of 1200-1400 mAh/g at 0.1C (10-hrs discharge), 4 times higher than commercial graphite anodes. These paper electrodes also exhibited excellent rate performance and superior cycling stability. A highly stable capacity around 500 mAh/g was retained for >1000 cycles at 1C rate (1-hr charge/discharge), with no obvious decay. This work provides a simple, scalable, and effective strategy for the fabrication of advanced electrode materials that can be used in wearable or structural electrochemical energy storage and conversion systems.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This article presents new findings related to the problem of the introduction of MXene phases into the silicon carbide matrix. The addition of MXene phases, as shown by the latest research, can significantly improve the mechanical properties of silicon carbide, including fracture toughness. Low fracture toughness is one of the main disadvantages that significantly limit its use. As a part of the experiment, two series of composites were produced with the addition of 2D-Ti3C2Tx MXene and 2D-Ti3C2Tx surface-modified MXene with the use of the sol-gel method with a mixture of Y2O3/Al2O3 oxides. The composites were obtained with the powder metallurgy technique and sintered with the Spark Plasma Sintering method at 1900 °C. The effect adding MXene phases had on the mechanical properties and microstructure of the produced sinters was investigated. Moreover, the influence of the performed surface modification on changes in the properties of the produced composites was determined. The analysis of the obtained results showed that during sintering, the MXene phases oxidize with the formation of carbon flakes playing the role of reinforcement. The influence of the Y2O3/Al2O3 layer on the structure of carbon flakes and the higher quality of the interface was also demonstrated. This was reflected in the higher mechanical properties of composites with the addition of modified Ti3C2Tx. Composites with 1 wt.% addition of Ti3C2Tx M are characterized with a fracture toughness of 5 MPa × m0.5, which is over 50% higher than in the case of the reference sample and over 15% higher than for the composite with 2.5 wt.% addition of Ti3C2Tx, which showed the highest fracture toughness in this series.',\n",

A total of 34.67˚ of polarization rotation is achieved with the variation of pump power from 0 to 223 mW. From the regression analysis, the system is operated in highly linear condition, with R2 value of 0.991 and an efficiency of 0.1589˚/mW.

       "  'abstract': 'MXene belongs to the family of 2D carbides and nitrides. The controlling of process parameters is key to obtain high-quality MXene films. The layered structure of MXene is obtained successfully by tuning the process parameters which is confirmed through the presence of XRD peak (110) at 2 theta value of 60 degrees. Moreover, the accordion-like structure of MXene is confirmed through SEM which is also highly dependent on the process parameters. It is also observed that if the etchant with sufficient concentration is used for an optimised time the (002) peak gets shifted to a lower angle and confirms the increase in spacing of MXene layers to 12.92\\xa0Å. Further reduction in the etching time leads to a decrease in the d-spacing of MXene layers due to the presence of aluminium and the presence of defects corresponding to the unsuccessful removal of AlF3 by-products which is confirmed by (106), (108) and (109) XRD peaks. However, the occurrence of (106), (108) and (109) peaks which correspond to the growth of AlF3 is highly dependent on any variation in process parameters. The increase in the quantity also impacts the properties of MXene formed. It can be seen that increasing the quantity of hydrofluoric acid will lead to thicken the MXene layers. If etching is done for the greater quantity of HF, the toxicity is increased which leads to the greater number of fluorine groups which will lead to an increase in the number of defects in the MXene material. This paper also discusses the correlation of process parameters with that of the electrical properties of MXene layers. It is found that to get the best MXene layers in terms of structurally and electrically, the process parameters need to tune in such a way that the etching of aluminium can be done completely without increasing the fluorine content in the MXene. Herein, we report for the first time the fabrication of best optimised MXene film on the flexible polypropylene (PP) substrate using the best optimised parameters for supercapacitor applications and compared with the Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and glass substrate results. The PP-supported MXene device exhibits lower contact resistance of 141 ohms and the areal capacitance of 82.6mF/cm2 at 5\\xa0mV/s and capacitive retention of 73.3%. The study opens up new possible designs for the high-performance devices employing different flake sizes, morphologies of MXene and their combinations.',\n",

Herein, we facilely prepared temperature-responsive MXene nanobelt fibers (T-RMFs) carrying vitamin E with a controllable release ability for wound healing. These T-RMFs were composed of MXene nanosheets spread along polyacrylonitrile and polyvinylpyrrolidone composite nanobelts together with a thermosensitive PAAV- coating layer. The high mass loading and high surface area of the MXene nanosheets endow the T-RMFs with excellent photothermal properties. The temperature could be easily controlled by near-infrared (NIR) irradiation exposure, and then the thermoresponsive polymeric coating layer relaxed the interface to dissolve vitamin E and promote vitamin E release. The T-RMFs demonstrated excellent biocompatibility and wound-healing functions in cellular and animal tests. The facile method, high mass loading, high surface area, excellent wound-healing functions, interesting nanosheet/nanobelt structure, mass production potential, and NIR responsive properties of these T-RMFs indicate the great potential of our nanobelts for wound healing, tissue engineering, and much broader application areas.

The plasma treated Ti3C2Tx films showed significantly better field emission properties than that of as-deposited Ti3C2Tx films. Compared to the Ar and O2 plasma treated Ti3C2Tx films, the H2 plasma treated Ti3C2Tx films displayed lower turn-on field (8.5 V/μm) and larger maximum current density (1222 μA cm−2).

However, the notorious issues of inevitable oxidation stability and surface-to-surface self-restacking for MXene significantly prevent its further wide-ranging application. Herein, the 3D macroporous oxidation-resistant Ti3C2Tx MXene/graphene/carbon nanotube (MRC) hybrid hydrogels are prepared by a simple gelation method assisted by l-cysteine as crosslinker and l-ascorbic acid (VC) as reductant. Benefitting from the effectively alleviated restacking, excellent electrical conductivity, and the 3D inter-crosslinked macroporous architecture, as a supercapacitor electrode, the obtained MRC aerogel exhibits a superior specific capacitance of 349 F g−1, unparalleled rate capability (52.0% at 3000\\xa0mV\\xa0s−1) and amazing cyclic stability (retention of 97.1% after 100\\xa0000 cycles). Moreover, the 3D MRC-30 aerogel exhibits an impressive oxidation-resistant performance with just a 9.3% increase in electrical resistance after storing in ambient condition for 60\\xa0days, effectively alleviating the oxidation problem of MXene.

The crystallization, melting behavior, and morphologies of neat iPP, iPP/MXene, iPP/WBG-II, and iPP/MXene/WBG-II were comparatively studied.

This tuneability along with the ‘layered’ nature of the material not only offer the flexibility to produce plasmon resonances across a wide range of wavelengths, but also add a degree of freedom to the sensing mechanism by allowing the plasma frequency to be modulated.

Inspired by the fact that the MXene contains thermodynamically metastable marginal transition metal atoms, the oxygen-vacancy-rich TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) in situ grown on the Ti3C2Tx nanosheets (TiO2/Ti3C2Tx) are prepared via a one-step ethanol-thermal treatment of the Ti3C2Tx MXene. The oxygen vacancies act as the main active sites for the NH3 synthesis. The highly conductive interior untreated Ti3C2Tx nanosheets could not only facilitate the electron transport but also avoid the self-aggregation of the TiO2 NPs. Meanwhile, the TiO2 NPs generation could enhance the SSA of the Ti3C2Tx in return. Accordingly, the as-prepared electrocatalyst exhibits an NH3 yield of 32.17 µg h−1 mg−1cat. at −0.55 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and a remarkable Faradaic efficiency of 16.07% at −0.45 V versus RHE in 0.1 m HCl, placing it as one of the most promising NRR electrocatalysts. Moreover, the density functional theory calculations confirm the lowest NRR energy barrier (0.40 eV) of TiO2 (101)/Ti3C2Tx compared with Ti3C2Tx or TiO2 (101) alone.',\n",

Strain sensors play an indispensable role as a member of wearable devices. Here, a strain film sensor with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and Ti3C2TX MXene, which is obtained by vacuum-assisted filtration and integrated onto a thermoplastic polyurethane substrate, is developed. Since the MWCNTs and Ti3C2TX MXene composite sensor has a characteristic ‘mud-brick’ microstructure. The sensor has the ability to detect various human movements, such as, bending of finger joints, wrists, elbow joints, and shoulder. The sensors show excellent mechanical property and can be folded more than 2000 times without failure. It also exhibits short response time, low detection limit, and wide range of use. In addition, the sensor shows excellent electrical heating performance. The temperature of the composite film can rise to 96.6\\xa0°C in a short period of time even under low voltage power supply (25 V). It likewise proves its excellent performance in terms of cyclability and long-time heating capability. The film has low production cost, easy preparation method, and simple operation. The MWCNT/Ti3C2TX MXene film can be integrated into wearable devices and shows great potential for future applications.\",\n",

We have thus investigated how modifying the anion sublattice of MXene can be used to address this challenge. \\n               In this presentation we will show the transformation of MXene sheets into TiOF2 2D sheets with superior electrochemical performance. MXene synthesized from Ti3AlC2 has been fluorinated for 3 - (FMX3), 6 - (FMX6), and 24 hours (FMX24), respectively by means of a direct fluorination process. Exposure of MXene powder to elemental fluorine for 3 hours induces the formation of CF2 groups and TiF3 on the surface, which have beneficial effects on the electrochemical performance. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy suggests that after fluorinating the MXene sample for 6 hours, that 2+ and 3+ Ti oxidation states are not present on the surface, with only Ti4+ present indicating TiOF2. X-ray diffraction indicates that there is TiOF2 present after fluorinating for 3 hours and after 24 hours the MXene has transformed to TiOF2 with minor impurities remaining, while maintaining the 2D layer morphology. All the fluorinated materials have cycling stabilities superior to MXene with capacities of > 200 mAh/g, which already has a good cycling stability with a stable capacity of ~ 100 mAh/g over 120 cycles. The electrochemical performance of FMX3 and FMX24 are superior as compared to MXene and FMX6, with the latter fluorinated MXene having a comparatively inferior performance. FMX24 with its TiOF2 phase has good capacity that increases with cycle number. FMX24 has a better rate capability as compared to a non 2D layered TiOF2, indicating the advantage of the 2D layered morphology derived from the parent MXene phase. These transformed MXene materials, in addition to being utilized as anode material for lithium ion batteries, can also be used beneficially in other battery chemistries such as lithium sulfur batteries.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Designing sustainable electrodes for next generation energy storage devices relies on the understanding of their fundamental properties at the nanoscale, including the comprehension of ions insertion into the electrode and their interactions with the active material. One consequence of ion storage is the change in the electrode volume resulting in mechanical strain and stress that can strongly affect the cycle life. Therefore, it is important to understand the changes of dimensions and mechanical properties occurring during electrochemical reactions. While the characterization of mechanical properties via macroscopic measurements is well documented, in-situ characterization of their evolution has never been achieved at the nanoscale. Two dimensional (2D) carbides, known as MXenes, are promising materials for supercapacitors and various kinds of batteries, as they demonstrate a high intercalation capacitance related to the rapid transport of ions within the structure [1]. \\n               \\xa0To date however, the intercalation mechanism is poorly understood and other techniques able to probe the dynamics are required. In this work, in situ Atomic Force Microscopy is used to monitor the strain developed in a Ti3C2\\n                  Tx\\n                   electrode during intercalation/extraction of monovalent and divalent cations in a variety of aqueous electrolytes. Interestingly, the electrode undergoes a large contraction during Li+, Na+ or Mg2+ intercalation, differentiating the Ti3C2 paper from conventional electrodes where redox intercalation of ions (e.g. Li+) into the bulk phase (e.g. graphite, silicon) results in volumetric expansion. The relative deformation amplitude strongly depends on the cation radius and electric charge ranging from almost no change to over 15% of shrinkage [2]. The unique mechanical changes induced by the presence of cations between the layers were investigated by Contact Resonance Atomic Force Microscopy [3]. Spatial mapping of the resonance frequency with high resolution showed that the elastic modulus of the carbide in the direction normal to the basal plane increases of 25 GPa when Li+ ions are intercalated, in good agreement with the strong interactions between MXene sheets that leads to contraction. However, no changes in the elasticity were observed during the intercalation of larger K+ ions. Furthermore, these measurements revealed that the cation intercalation preferentially occurs at the shallow sites of the MXene flakes.\\n               \\xa0These results are exciting because they shed light on the intricate interplay of the MXene mechanical properties with the electrochemical performance by controlling the solid/liquid interface. Moreover, they show that the cation dynamics in the confined 2D spaces can be efficiently probed with in-situ AFM techniques. \\n               \\xa0The experiments and sample preparation in this work were supported as part of the Fluid Interface Reactions, Structures and Transport (FIRST) Center, an Energy Frontier Research Center funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences.

In situ synchrotron XRD examination reveals that capacity contribution originates from reversible reactions of Li ion alloying with Bi and intercalating into Li2MoO4 components during charge/discharge cycles. The composition of Ti3C2 MXene with Bi2Mo3O12 significantly improves cycle stability and rate capability performance.\\n         \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAbstract\\n\\nMetal oxides are widely evaluated as high-capacity anode candidates for practical lithium ion battery applications, owing to their attractive volumetric and gravimetric capacities compared with the traditional graphite anode. Synergistic effects on improving electrochemical performance of binary metal oxide anodes have been increasingly reported via different working mechanisms for lithium storage instead of simple combination of two single components. Herein, we report on exploring lithium storage mechanism in Bi2Mo3O12 binary metal oxide for the first time as an anode material. In-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction measurements are performed on this exotic material to elucidate lithium storage behaviors, coupled with voltage-resolved cyclic voltammetry and ex-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses. The Bi2Mo3O12 anode undergoes an irreversible initial conversion reaction, resulting in metallic Bi and Li2MoO4 components through electrochemical lithiation. During successive cycling, these two components reversibly uptake and release Li ions through alloying/de-alloying and intercalation/de-intercalation reactions, by forming corresponding Li3Bi alloy and excessively-lithiated Li2+xMoO4 derivative, respectively. Cycling stability of the Bi2Mo3O12 anode material is considerably enhanced by in-situ composition with Ti3C2-based MXene nanosheets. The Bi2Mo3O12@Ti3C2 composite anode material can deliver an initial charge capacity of approximately 846\\u2005mAh\\u2009g−1 at 50\\u2005mA\\u2009g−1 and retain at 227\\u2005mAh\\u2009g−1 upon prolonged 1000\\u2005cycles at 2.5\\u2005A\\u2009g−1 high charge/discharge current density.

Finally, the adsorption enthalpy of water molecules on the surface of Mxene was explored by DFT calculation. It was found that residual F- played an important role in humitity sensing\\n               \\n                  Introduction:\\n               \\n               The new two-dimensional (2D) material Mxene has been widely used in energy storage , battery , catalysis , electromagnetic shielding and other directions since it was discovered by the research team of Professor Yury Gogotsi of Drexel University in 2011.Ti3C2Tx has good electronic conductivity and hydrophilicity, it is the most widely studied and mature of all Mxenes. This work combines Mxene-Ti3C2Tx with the QCM test platform to further enhance the application of Mxene materials on humidity sensors.\\n               By optimizing the method in the previous literature, the Ti3AlC2 powder was etched in LiF / HCl solution to remove the Al element, some post-treatment such us ultrasonic was carry out to obtain a single-layer Ti3C2Tx solution that can be used to directly prepare the device. The obtained samples were characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, EDS, XPS and BET, etc, it was found that Mxene with a large specific surface area has a good single-layer sheet structure, and the surface contains a large number of -OH, -O, -F functional groups. This single-layer sheet structure with large specific surface area and abundant active sites is more conducive to the adsorption of water molecules. By detecting the relative humidity of 11.3% - 97.3% shows that the sensor with the best performance has excellent sensitivity of 12.8Hz/% RH, 6s and 2s (@ 90%) rapid response/recovery time, maximum humidity hysteresis of 1.16%RH, good short-term repeatability, long-term stability, and excellent cross-sensitivity. Through characterization and simulation, it is found that -F functional group plays a certain role in the excellent humidity sensitivity. This not only provides a new possibility for the application of 2D materials in humidity sensor, but also widens the application of Mxene materials in sensor field.\\n               \\n                  \\n                     \\n                  \\n               \\n               Figure 1',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\n               Recently, two-dimension transition metal carbides, carbonitrides, and nitrides called MXenes have attracted huge attention due to their outstanding physical properties in various fields. Here we highlight the enormous potential of MXenes as nonlinear optical materials in the laser technologies, which includes ultrafast laser pulse generation, laser frequency modulation based on four-wave mixing, and photonic diodes with time reversal symmetry breaking. Emphasis is placed on the wide spectral applicability of metallic MXene saturable absorbers in passively mode-locked femtosecond laser technologies, allowing for operation in the visible to mid-infrared range. The Z-scan analysis reveals that Ti3C2Tx MXene has a large nonlinear optical absorption coefficient and a negative nonlinear refractive index, and notably it also possesses the higher threshold for light-induced damage with 50% increase in nonlinear transmittance. The MXene/C60 stacked modules enable the achievement of nonreciprocal transmission of laser pulses for photonic rectification. We strongly believe that MXenes will play a significant role in advanced laser technologies such as optical information processing, molecular spectroscopy, and micromachining, while providing many insightful electro-optical applications.',\n",

Herein, by using two-dimensional conductive MXene as a multifunctional binder instead of conventional insulating polymer binders such as poly(vinylidene fluoride) or carboxymethylcellulose sodium (PVDF and CMC, respectively), a free-standing, flexible Si@C film was fabricated by simple vacuum filtration and directly used as anode for LIBs. In the MXene-bonded Si@C film, MXene constructed a three-dimensional conductive framework in which Si@C nanocomposites were embedded. Its loose and porous structure provided much space to buffer the large volume expansion of Si@C nanoparticles and thus led to significantly superior cycle stability compared with conventional CMC- and PVDF-bonded Si@C electrodes. Moreover, the porous structure and the metallically conductive MXene offered fast ion transport and outstanding conductivity of the MXene-bonded Si@C film, which were favorable for its rate performance. These results promise good potential of the MXene-bonded Si@C film electrode for LIBs.',\n",

Nevertheless, the functionalization of Ti3C2 MQDs to improve their properties is just in its infant stage. Herein, we firstly synthesized nitrogen and boron co-doped Ti3C2 MQDs (N, B-Ti3C2 MQDs) with good water solubility, strong stability, and high optical characteristics. The N, B-Ti3C2 MQDs exhibit excitation wavelength-dependent blue photoluminescence with optimal excitation/emission peaks at 335/439\\xa0nm. Nowadays, the development of fast and real-time detection of tetracycline (TC) in animal derived food is very essential. In this work, a novel point-of-care testing (POCT) platform was established based on ratiometric fluorescence method using N, B-Ti3C2 MQDs coupled with Eu3+. Upon addition of TC in the Eu3+/N, B-MQDs system, blue fluorescence emission of N, B-Ti3C2 MQDs was quenched and red fluorescence emission of Eu3+ was enhanced gradually, which was ascribed to the synergistic inner filter effect and antenna effect. Moreover, we prepared test papers with N, B-Ti3C2 MQDs and Eu3+ for TC detection based on the change of fluorescence color, which could be recognized by color recognizer app installed in the smartphone. Therefore,  great promise for POCT of TC is given\\xa0with the merits of simplicity\\xa0and visible detection possibility.\\xa0The proposed method demonstrated a low detection limit of 20\\xa0nM.

However, large volume expansion and low electrical conductivity restrict commercialization of Si anodes, while dendrite formation prohibits the applications of lithium-metal anodes. Here, uniform nanoporous Si@carbon (NPSi@C) from commercial alloy and CO2 is fabricated and tested as a stable anode for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). The porosity of Si as well as graphitization degree and thickness of the carbon layer can be controlled by adjusting reaction conditions. The rationally designed porosity and carbon layer of NPSi@C can improve electronic conductivity and buffer volume change of Si without destroying the carbon layer or disrupting the solid electrolyte interface layer. The optimized NPSi@C anode shows a stable cyclability with 0.00685% capacity decay per cycle at 5 A g−1 over 2000 cycles for LIBs. The energy storage mechanism is explored by quantitative kinetics analysis and proven to be a capacitance-battery dual model. Moreover, a novel 2D/3D structure is designed by combining MXene and NPSi@C. As lithiophilic nucleation seeds, NPSi@C can induce uniform Li deposition with buffered volume expansion, which is proven by exploring Li-metal deposition morphology on Cu foil and MXene@NPSi@C. The practical potential application of NPSi@C and MXene@NPSi@C is evaluated by full cell tests with a Li(Ni0.8Co0.1Mn0.1)O2 cathode.',\n",

Also, the bandgap changes from 0.9eV (for pristine MXene) to 0.1eV (for Nb-doped MXene) which gives signature of increased conductivity due to more metallic nature.

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\n\\nA simple and novel electrochemical immunoassay based on MXene (Ti3C2)−Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) was designed for sensitive screening of a disease-related biomarker, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), by using dopamine-loaded liposomes (DLL) for signal amplification. The system involves two parts, namely, sandwich-type immunoreaction to capture DLL and electrochemical measurement of dopamine. The target PSA can cause a specific antigen-antibody reaction and DLL are enriched in the enzyme-labeled pores. After Triton X-100 is injected into the detection cell, the carried DLL was quickly cracked to release dopamine wrapped in the cavity. A nanocomposite consisting of MXene (Ti3C2) support to immobilize Au nanoparticles (Ti3C2−Au) was utilized to modify a glassy carbon electrode, which gives a strongly enhanced differential pulse voltammetric (DPV) signals for dopamine. In this case, the change of DPV signal depends on the amount of dopamine released by liposomes, which is further positively correlated with the concentration of the analyte PSA. Combining the of MXene (Ti3C2)−AuNPs nanomaterials (large specific surface area, excellent electrical conductivity, and good electrocatalytic properties) with the liposome signal amplification strategy, the electrochemical immunoassay exhibited excellent performance toward PSA determination with a broad linear range of 1\\u2005pg/mL to 50 ng/mL and limit of detection down to 0.31\\u2005pg/mL (S/N=3) under the optimized testing conditions. High specificity for PSA over other disease-related biomarkers and acceptable nanocomposite/electrode stability were acquired. The excellent analytical performance shows that the current strategy provides an effective detection platform for clinical sample analysis.',\n",

The Nb2C solution was first prepared using the liquid exfoliation technique, and then deposited onto a microfiber for integration into the laser cavity. Stable mode-locking operation was observed in both laser cavities, where the center wavelengths of the laser were recorded at 1944 nm for the TDFL and 1950 nm for the THDFL. The generated pulses in the TDFL and THDFL had repetition rates of 9.35 and 11.76 MHz respectively, while their corresponding pulse widths were 1.67 and 1.34 ps. Both of the lasers were highly stable, having SNR values of more than 52 dB and showed no major fluctuations when tested for their long-term stabilities.

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\nTwo-dimensional MXene-based film materials as flexible electrodes have been widely studied in wearable micro-supercapacitors (MSCs). However, the existence of strong van der Waals interaction leads to serious self-stacking of MXene layers, resulting in poor ionic dynamics and loss of active sites, which makes MXene film electrode exhibits low capacitance and poor rate performance in practical studies. To solve this, a frame-structured hybrid film (labeled as CN-MX hybrid film) is constructed by introducing intercalating agents (nanometer g-C3N4  ) into MXene layers. In this unique hybrid film, the g-C3N4  nanoparticles rationally occupy the interspace between MXene layers so as to alleviate layer stacking, thus effectively expanding the electrochemically active surface and promoting proton transfer. Synergistic pseudocapacitance inducted by g-C3N4  surface groups, consequently, the CN-MX hybrid film electrode achieves an enhanced capacitive capability. In the three-electrode system, this frame-structured film electrode exhibits an ultrahigh areal capacitance of 1932.8 mF cm-2. The assembled symmetry flexible MSC device based on CN-MX hybrid film can achieve an energy density of 2.28 µWh cm-2  at 0.075 mW cm-2, as well as a superior cyclic stability with 90.4% retention after 700 cycles in alternating 90o  bending and releasing states, revealing its potential in practical application.',\n",

The construction of an interface protective layer (IPL) has proved to be one of the effective ways to improve the stability of zinc anodes, but it remains a challenge to achieve multi-functionality. Herein, tetramethylammonium-intercalated Ti  3  C  2  T  x  MXene (MX-TMA) coating with a low zinc nucleation barrier was  in-situ  constructed on the surface of zinc foil by a facile self-assembly method. It provides the IPL with abundant zincophilic sites and better hydrophilicity, which promotes the transport of Zn  2+  for uniform electrodeposition and inhibits interface side reactions. Moreover, the directional deposition of zinc on the beneficial (002) plane guided by MX-TMA is further revealed. As a result, the lifespan of the zinc electrode under 2 mA cm  –2  is prolonged by 3600 h. Even under deep discharge (DOD  Zn  ≈85%), the MX-TMA@Zn anode can still achieve stable cycles for more than 450 h. Furthermore, the full battery assembled with the Mn-based cathode also demonstrated superior performance. This work provides an in-depth mechanism analysis and inspiration for IPL design, thus advancing the development and practical application of ZIBs.',\n",

Monolayer graphene has tiny mass and large young’ modulus, which make it extremely promising in membrane of CMUTs.

How to endow anisotropy and a wide application temperature range for traditional homogeneous conductive hydrogels and flexible sensors is still a challenge.

Due to the anisotropy of MXene conductive hydrogels, the mechanical properties and electrical conductivity are enhanced in specific directions. The hydrogels have a wide temperature resistance range of −36 to 25\\xa0°C through solvent substitution. Thus, the muscle-inspired MXene conductive hydrogels with anisotropy and low-temperature resistance can be used as wearable flexible sensors. The sensing signals are further displayed on the mobile phone as images through wireless technology, and images will change with the collected signals to achieve motion detection. Multiple flexible sensors are also assembled into a 3D sensor array for detecting the magnitude and spatial distribution of forces or strains.

Titanium carbide MXene (Ti3C2Tx), in particular, has shown significant energy-storage capability. However, previously, only micrometer-thick, nontransparent films were studied. Here, highly transparent and conductive Ti3C2Tx films and their application as transparent, solid-state supercapacitors are reported. Transparent films are fabricated via spin-casting of Ti3C2Tx nanosheet colloidal solutions, followed by vacuum annealing at 200 °C. Films with transmittance of 93% (≈4 nm) and 29% (≈88 nm) demonstrate DC conductivity of ≈5736 and ≈9880 S cm−1, respectively. Such highly transparent, conductive Ti3C2Tx films display impressive volumetric capacitance (676 F cm−3) combined with fast response. Transparent solid-state, asymmetric supercapacitors (72% transmittance) based on Ti3C2Tx and single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) films are also fabricated. These electrodes exhibit high capacitance (1.6 mF cm−2) and energy density (0.05 µW h cm−2), and long lifetime (no capacitance decay over 20 000 cycles), exceeding that of graphene or SWCNT-based transparent supercapacitor devices.

Among all present desalination technologies, reverse osmosis (RO) has been demonstrated as one of the most feasible processes. However, the main limitation with RO and other membrane-based techniques is costly operation and maintenance associated with membrane scaling, fouling, and degradation. Advanced membranes that enable ultrafast permeation while maintaining good mechanical properties, are very important to facilitate both water purification and desalination technologies. Low-dimensional nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes, cellulose nanocrystals and graphene oxide (GO) have been tested in membranes due to their good mechanical properties and amenable surface functionalization. Specifically, GO nanosheets have recently emerged as a new material for ultrathin, high-flux and energy-efficient sieving membranes due to GO's unique two-dimensional atomically thin structure, outstanding mechanical strength and good flexibility, as well as good dispersion in aqueous solutions. However, selectivity and stability of fully wetted GO membranes in cross-flow conditions has remained challenging and solubility of GO can also lead to membrane disintegration under operation conditions. Herein we present MXenes [1], a new class of 2D carbides, as new promising membrane materials for water desalination applications. For this purpose, Ti3C2-based MXene membranes have been prepared by a vacuum-assisted filtration technique. In order to detect the permeated ions and molecules, we have performed electrical conductivity measurements and UV-Vis analyses. The results have shown that MXene membranes are selective towards ions of different size/charge, such as Cu2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, SO42-, and Cl-. The permeation data have also shown a cut-off trend around 4 Å, and species of a larger size have been sieved out. The transport mechanism through MXene membrane films has been therefore size and charge selective due to the presence of the interlayer slit pores and the negative charges on the hydrophilic Ti3C2-based MXene film surfaces. In this study, we compare MXene membranes with GO membranes to better understand differences in their water desalination performance. Indeed these novel membrane composites are expected to improve the flux, increase the salt rejection efficiency and decrease adhesion of the adsorbed particulates and organic molecules, thus mitigating fouling.

       "  'abstract': 'Application of two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials for energy storage devices such as batteries or supercapacitors has been proposed many times since properties of the materials at such scale offer short ion transport routes and high surface area [1]. Most recently, the potential of Ti3CN transition metal carbides (MXenes) as anodes of Li-ion batteries was proposed [2]. However, realization of such applications has lacked so far a flexible, scalable, reproducible and cost-effective manufacturing method. The fabrication of 2D nanomaterials by liquid phase exfoliation allows production of large amounts of these materials at low prices [3], but fabrication of devices based on such materials at competitive rates is still a challenge. \\n               Ink-jet printing is employed by many research groups for fabrication of nanomaterials-based devices since it’s a highly flexible technique enabling to adjust process parameters quickly and to vary the devices’ design dynamically [4]. While on research level ink-jet printing is a very useful tool, the scalability of the process is limited and transition to mass production not trivial. Therefore, it would be favorable to employ techniques which are closer to high volume fabrication in their process principle from first lab experiments on. \\n               In this work, a simple yet effective method was employed to rapidly reproduce structures for supercapacitors on various substrates. The method comprises stamps which were 3D printed by fused deposition modelling (FDM) and MXene loaded inks. \\n               The very simple process of depositing involves coating the stamp with Ti3CN ink and pressing it onto a substrate subsequently. As stamp printing is a very fast and easy to execute process it provides a proper tool to rapidly produce a large number of identical devices. Various different materials were evaluated to serve as substrates, such as paper, glass and PET, demonstrating the high flexibility of the process. \\n               Electrochemical analysis of the devices was performed and comparative results thereof are discussed in this work. \\n               Using a 3D printer to fabricate the stamps enables dynamic change of the design of the capacitor to adapt to previously performed tests. \\n               The figure shows a stamped capacitor structure on paper substrate, a photograph of 3D printed stamps with varying capacitor designs and a CV graph of said printed device. \\n               While being fast and easy to handle in the lab, the working principle of stamp printing relies on the same mechanics as roll to roll printing, which is a high volume printing technology. This approach promises high scalability potential while simultaneously it stays flexible and adaptive to rapid changes\\xa0making it\\xa0suitable for research and development works. First results of the electrochemical characterization of the devices show good capacitive behaviors with rectangular CV shapes. \\n               References: \\n                     \\n                        Ma, R. and Sasaki, T., Nanosheets of Oxides and Hydroxides: Ultimate 2D Charge-Bearing Functional Crystallites.

       "  'abstract': 'AbstractA new 2D titanium carbide (Ti3C2), a low dimensional material of the MXene family has attracted remarkable interest in several electronic applications, but its unique structure and novel properties are still less explored in piezoelectric energy harvesters. Herein, a systematic study has been conducted to examine the role of Ti3C2 multilayers when it is incorporated in the piezoelectric polymer host. The 0.03\\xa0g/L of Ti3C2 has been identified as the most appropriate concentration to ensure the optimum performance of the fabricated device with a generated output voltage of about 6.0\\xa0V. The probable reasons might be due to the uniformity of nanofiller distribution in the polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) and the incorporation of Ti3C2 in a polymer matrix is found to enhance the β-phase of PVDF and diminish the undesired α-phase configuration. Low tapping frequency and force were demonstrated to scavenge electrical energy from abundant mechanical energy resources particularly human motion and environmental stimuli. The fabricated device attained a power density of 14\\xa0µW.cm−2 at 10.8 MΩ of load resistor which is considerably high among 2D material-based piezoelectric nanogenerators. The device has also shown stable electrical performance for up to 4\\xa0weeks and is practically able to store energy in a capacitor and light up a LED.

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\n               The irrational NH3 emission routinely poses a significant threat to human health and environmental protection even at low dose. In addition, high miniaturization and low power-consumption has been the critical requirements of Internet of Things. To meet these demands, it is greatly pressing to develop a novel gas sensor with the capability to detect trace NH3 without external heating or light-irradiation elements. In this work, the organic conducting conjugated polymer PEDOT:PSS was combined with inorganic nitrogen-doped transition metal carbides and nitrides (N-MXene Ti3C2T\\n                     x\\n                  ) for chemiresistive NH3 sensing at room temperature (20 oC). By means of the organic–inorganic n–p heterojunctions via the synergistic effect, the results show that the composite film sensor with the optimal mass ratio of 1:0.5 between N-MXene and PEDOT:PSS components delivered favorable NH3 sensing performance than individual N-MXene or PEDOT:PSS counterparts in terms of higher response and quicker response/recovery speeds under 20 oC@36%RH air. Besides, decent repeatability, stability and selectivity were demonstrated. The incorporated N atoms served as excellent electron donors to promote the electron-transfer reactions and augment the sorption sites. Simultaneously, partial oxidation of MXene brought about some TiO2 nanoparticles which acted as spacers to widen the interlayer spacing and probably suppress the MXene restacking during the film deposition, thus favoring the gas diffusion/penetration within the sensing layer and then a quick reaction kinetic. The modulation of consequent build-in field within the heterojunctions was responsible for the reversible NH3 sensing. In addition, pre-adsorbed water molecules facilitated to establish a swift adsorption/desorption balance. The proposed strategy expanded the application range of MXene based composite materials and enrich the current sensing mechanisms of NH3 gas sensors.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\n               Generally, commercial textiles show high mid-infrared emissivity and the thermal radiation accounts around 50% of the heat loss. However, conventional clothes usually increase the thickness to reduce the heat conduction without considering lowering the mid-IR emissivity. Thus textiles with reducing infrared emissivity for passive radiative heating offer an energy-free way to keep human body warm. Herein, we reduced mid-IR emissivity of the textiles by covering Ti3C2Tx MXene sheet on the cotton fabric through dip coating. MXenes as a new family of two-dimensional (2D) materials shows strong absorption in visible and near-IR regions and strong reflection in mid-IR region. Through simple and scalable method of dip coating, we fabricate four samples with different MXene content from 0.05 mg/cm2 to 0.20 mg/cm2 with 0.277∼0.431 mid-IR emissivity. This material and preparation method can be used for personal thermal management on traditional clothing.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'AbstractThe output power of the triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) strongly depends on the performance of triboelectric materials, especially microstructures and functional groups of them. In this work, aiming at the excellent triboelectric ability, alternate-layered MXene composite films-based TENG with abundant fluorine groups(-F) through layer-by-layer stacking are designed and fabricated. Benefitting from the uniform intrinsic microstructure and increased dielectric constant, when the amount of the Nb2CTx nanosheets increases to 15 wt%, the TENG based on Nb2CTx/Ti3C2Tx composite nanosheets films achieves the maximum output. The short-circuit current density of 8.06\\xa0μA/cm2 and voltage of 34.63\\xa0V are 8.4 times and 3.5 times over that of pure Ti3C2Tx films, and 3.3 times and 4.3 times over that of commercial poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) films, respectively. Furthermore, the fabricated TENG could be attached to human body to harvest energy from human motions, such as typing, texting, and hand clapping. The results demonstrate that the alternate-layered MXene composite nanosheet films through layer-by-layer stacking possess remarkably triboelectric performance, which broaden the choice of negative triboelectric materials and supply a new choice for high output TENG.',\n",

This work delicately designs a Mn3(PO4)2/MXene heterostructured biomimetic enzyme by assembling two-dimensional (2-D) Mn3(PO4)2 nanosheets with biomimetic activity and 2-D MXene nanosheets with high conductivity and abundant functional groups. The 2-D nature of the two components with strong interfacial interaction synergistically enables the heterostructure an excellent flexibility with retained 100% of the response when to reach a bending angle up to 180°, and 96% of the response after 100 bending/relaxing cycles. It is found that the surface charge state of the heterostructure promotes the adsorption of O2•−, while the high-energy active site improves electrochemical oxidation of O2•−. The Mn3(PO4)2/MXene as a sensing platform towards O2•− achieves a high sensitivity of 64.93 µA·µM−1·cm−2, a wide detection range of 5.75 nM to 25.93 µM, and a low detection limit of 1.63 nM. Finally, the flexible heterostructured sensing platform realizes real-time monitoring of O2•− in live cell assays, offering a promising flexible biosensor towards exploring various biological processes.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Pillaring technologies have been considered as an effective way to improve lithium storage performance of Ti3C2Tx MXene. Nevertheless, the pillared hybrids suffer from sluggish Li+ diffusion kinetics and electronic transportation due to the compact multi-layered MXene structure, thus exhibiting inferior rate performance. Herein, the few-layered Ti3C2 MXene (f-Ti3C2 MXene) which is free from restacking can be prepared quickly based on the NH4+ ions method. Besides, Fe nanocomplex pillared few-layered Ti3C2Tx (FPTC) heterostructures are fabricated via the intercalation of Fe ions into the interlayer of f-Ti3C2 MXene. The f-Ti3C2 MXene which is immune to restacking can provide a highly conductive substrate for the rapid transport of Li+ ions and electrons and possess adequate electrolyte accessible area. Moreover, f-Ti3C2 MXene can efficiently relieve the aggregation, prevent the pulverization and buffer the large volume change of Fe nanocomplex during lithiation/delithiation process, leading to enhanced charge transfer kinetics and excellent structural stability of FPTC composites. Consequently, the FPTC hybrids exhibit a high capacity of 535 mAh·g−1 after 150 cycles at 0.5 A·g−1 and an enhanced rate performance with 310 mAh·g−1 after 850 cycles at 5 A·g−1. This strategy is facile, universal and can be extended to fabricate various few-layered MXene-derived hybrids with superior rate capability.',\n",

Broadly speaking, electrochemical sensors include not only conventional electrochemical biosensors or non-biosensors, but also emerging electrochemiluminescence (ECL) sensors and photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensors which are both combined with optical methods. In addition, various electrochemical sensing devices have been developed for practical purposes, such as multiplexed simultaneous detection of disease-related biomarkers and non-invasive body fluid monitoring. For the further performance improvement of electrochemical sensors, material is crucial. Recent years, a kind of two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterial MXene containing transition metal carbides, nitrides and carbonitrides, with unique structural, mechanical, electronic, optical, and thermal properties, have attracted a lot of attention form analytical chemists, and widely applied in electrochemical sensors. Here, we reviewed electrochemical sensors based on MXene from Nov. 2014 (when the first work about electrochemical sensor based on MXene published) to Mar. 2021, dividing them into different types as electrochemical biosensors, electrochemical non-biosensors, electrochemiluminescence sensors, photoelectrochemical sensors and flexible sensors. We believe this review will be of help to those who want to design or develop electrochemical sensors based on MXene, hoping new inspirations could be sparked.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The ability of long-term thermo-oxidative resistance is very important for elastomers in application. However, many conventional antioxidants are difficult to realize the long-term thermo-oxidative resistance. To overcome this limitation, a design strategy is introduced by combing elastomers with MXene and natural rubber (NR) is chosen as a model material. MXene is efficient in absorbing oxygen and the generated free radicals in the NR matrix and can inhibit the diffusion of oxygen toward the interior. Moreover, MXene, like graphene and carbon black, absorbs molecular chains, inhibiting the migration of MXene toward the surface of the sample. Such characteristics of MXene endow NR/MXene with the long-term outstanding thermo-oxidative resistance. For example, after three days of the thermo-oxidative process for NR/MXene, the tensile strength is 19 MPa and the retention of tensile strength is 63%, which far exceeds the effects of conventional antioxidants. This work not only provides a good guide for the universal design of elastomers with long-term thermo-oxidative resistance but also expands the application of MXene.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\n\\nStructural design on the atomic level can provide novel chemistries of hybrid MAX phases and their MXenes. Herein, density functional theory is used to predict phase stability of quaternary i-MAX phases with in-plane chemical order and a general chemistry (W2/3M21/3)2AC, where M2 = Sc, Y (W), and A = Al, Si, Ga, Ge, In, and Sn. Of over 18 compositions probed, only two—with a monoclinic C2/c structure—are predicted to be stable: (W2/3Sc1/3)2AlC and (W2/3Y1/3)2AlC and indeed found to exist. Selectively etching the Al and Sc/Y atoms from these 3D laminates results in W1.33C-based MXene sheets with ordered metal divacancies. Using electrochemical experiments, this MXene is shown to be a new, promising catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction. The addition of yet one more element, W, to the stable of M elements known to form MAX phases, and the synthesis of a pure W-based MXene establishes that the etching of i-MAX phases is a fruitful path for creating new MXene chemistries that has hitherto been not possible, a fact that perforce increases the potential of tuning MXene properties for myriad applications.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The interlayer regulation of layered environmental adsorption materials such as two-dimensional early transition metal carbides and carbonitrides (MXenes) plays an important role in their purification performance for specific pollutants. Here the enhanced uptake of ThIV by multilayered titanium carbides (Ti3C2Tx) through a hydrated intercalation strategy is reported. ThIV adsorption behaviors of three Ti3C2Tx samples with different c lattice parameters were studied as a function of contact time, pH, initial concentration, temperature and ion strength in batch experiments. The results indicated that the ThIV uptake was pH and ionic strength dependent, and the adsorption process followed the pseudo-second-order kinetics and the heterogeneous isotherm (Freundlich) model. Thermodynamic data suggested that the adsorption process of all MXene samples was a spontaneous endothermic reaction. The dimethyl sulfoxide intercalated hydrated Ti3C2Tx featured the largest interlayer space and exhibited the highest ThIV adsorption capacity (162\\u2005mg\\u2005g−1 at pH 3.4 or 112\\u2005mg\\u2005g−1 at pH 3.0), reflecting the significant increase in available adsorption sites from Ti3C2Tx interlayers. The adsorption mechanism has been clarified based on adsorption experiments and spectroscopic characterizations. An ion exchange process was proposed for the interaction between hydrated MXenes and ThIV, where H+ from surface [Ti−O]−H+ groups were the primary active sites on Ti3C2Tx. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) fitting results, in combination with X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analyses, clearly indicated that ThIV mainly formed the outer-sphere complexes on Ti3C2Tx surface through electrostatic interaction under strong acid conditions, while at pH > 3.0 the adsorption mechanism was determined by inner-sphere coordination and electrostatic interaction together.',\n",

The room-temperature thermal conductivity along the armchair direction is determined to be 86.25~131.2 Wm−1\\u2009K−1 with a flake length of 5~100\\u2009μm. The room temperature thermal expansion coefficient of Hf2CO2 is 6.094\\u2009×\\u200910−6 K−1, which is lower than that of most metals. Moreover, Hf2CO2 is determined to be a semiconductor with a band gap of 1.657\\u2009eV and to have high and anisotropic carrier mobility. At room temperature, the Hf2CO2 hole mobility in the armchair direction (in the zigzag direction) is determined to be as high as 13.5\\u2009×\\u2009103\\u2009cm2V−1s−1 (17.6\\u2009×\\u2009103\\u2009cm2V−1s−1). Thus, broader utilization of Hf2CO2, such as the material for nanoelectronics, is likely. The corresponding thermal and electrical properties of Ti2CO2 and Zr2CO2 are also provided. Notably, Ti2CO2 presents relatively lower thermal conductivity but much higher carrier mobility than Hf2CO2. According to the present results, the design and application of MXene based devices are expected to be promising.',\n",

The TENS also shows excellent stability after more than 10\\u2009000 continuous operations. This simple-structured, cost-effective and durable TENS device provides new insights into the methodology of heavy metal ion detection and can be further developed for the detection of the corresponding ions in serum.',\n",

Morphology regulation strategies assembling 2D MXene sheets into 3D architecture have endowed the as-formed porous MXene with a better performance in various fields. However, the direct patterning strategy for the porous MXene into integration with multifunctional and multichannel electronic devices still needs to be investigated. The metal-assisted electro-gelation method the authors propose can directly generate porous-structured MXene hydrogel with a tunable feature. By electrolyzing the sacrificial metal, the released metal cations initiate the electro-gelation process during which electrostatic interactions occur between cations and the MXene sheets. A high spatial resolution down to micro-meter level is achieved utilizing the method, enabling high-performance hydrogels with more complex architectures. Electronics prepared through this metal-assisted electro-gelation process have shown promising applications of the porous MXene in energy and biochemical sensing fields.

In this work, 2D Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets with high electrical conductivity and mobility were employed as a nanosized additive to prepare 2D Ruddlesden–Popper perovskite films. The PCE of solar cells was increased from 13.69 (without additive) to 15.71% after incorporating the Ti3C2Tx nanosheets with an optimized concentration. This improved performance is attributed to the enhanced crystallinity, orientation, and passivated trap states in the 3D phase that result in accelerated charge transfer process in vertical direction. More importantly, the unencapsulated cells exhibited excellent stability under ambient conditions with 55\\u2009±\\u20095% relative humidity.',\n",

Organic electrolytes and room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) can provide higher potential windows, leading to higher energy density. The large cation size of RTIL hinders its intercalation in-between the layers of MXene limiting the specific capacitance in comparison to aqueous electrolytes. In this work, different chain lengths alkylammonium (AA) cations are intercalated into Ti3C2Tx, producing variation of MXene interlayer spacings (d-spacing). AA-cation-intercalated Ti3C2Tx (AA-Ti3C2), exhibits higher specific capacitances, and cycling stabilities than pristine Ti3C2Tx in 1 m 1-ethly-3-methylimidazolium bis-(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)-imide (EMIMTFSI) in acetonitrile and neat EMIMTFSI RTIL electrolytes. Pre-intercalated MXene with an interlayer spacing of ≈2.2\\xa0nm, can deliver a large specific capacitance of 257 F g−1 (1428 mF cm−2 and 492 F cm−3) in neat EMIMTFSI electrolyte leading to high energy density. Quasi elastic neutron scattering and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy are used to study the dynamics of confined RTIL in pre-intercalated MXene. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest significant differences in the structures of RTIL ions and AA cations inside the Ti3C2Tx interlayer, providing insights into the differences in the observed electrochemical behavior.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\nTi3C2Tx MXenes, which are fabricated by removal of main group element from the corresponding transition metal carbides, have been actively studied due to their superior energy storage performance. However, the low efficiency in removal of main group element (named as chemical etching) has significantly limited the application of MXene or MXene-related materials. Herein, we demonstrated an ultrasound-assisted approach to synthesize Ti3C2Tx MXene material by using Ti3AlC2 as the precursor. A variety of characterization results showed that the efficiency of chemical etching of Ti3AlC2 was dramatically promoted by ultrasound. The timescale of etching was greatly shortened to 8 hours while typically 24 hours is sufficient in dilute hydrofluoric acid. Particularly, the high etching efficiency was achieved by using 2% hydrofluoric acid with the aid of ultrasound, which is lower in concertation than those reported in the previous literature. The specific capacitance of the 8h sonicated sample is 155 F/g, which is much higher than that of the un-sonicated sample prepared with same the experimental conditions. Additionally, the specific capacitance retention of the prepared 8h sonicated sample was 97.5% after 20000 cycles of charging/discharging, exhibiting an outstanding energy storage stability compared with the materials reported in previous literatures. It was proposed that removal of AlF3 from the surface of the etched particles was significantly promoted and the hydrogen bonds between the terminations of two different adjacent layers were broken by the acoustic cavitation effect of ultrasound.',\n",

Among the reported transition metal sulfides, the patronite (VS4) form of vanadium sulfide is less explored and understanding its charge storage mechanisms is unusual in the literature. Here, we report the pseudocapacitive energy storage performance of patronite (VS4) nano-bundles synthesized via template-free hydrothermal approach by fabricating a solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor device (SSAD) with MXene (Ti3C2Tx) as the negative electrode. The fabricated VS4//MXene SSAD displayed a remarkable supercapacitive behavior in an expanded working potential window of 1.3\\xa0V. The device demonstrated a record high performance with the areal capacitance of 70.9 mF/cm2 at the scan rate of 5\\xa0mV/s and demonstrated ~ 4.5 and ~ 6 times superior areal capacitance as compared to the bare VS4 nano-bundles and MXene-based symmetric devices. Further, the device displayed an excellent energy density of 5.65 mW h/cm2 with a remarkable power density of 290.9 mW/cm2 and good cyclic stability ~ 75% after 3000 cycles in neutral electrolyte. Moreover, we have performed extensive density functional theory simulations to present electronic properties of VS4 and MXene supporting pseudocapacitive behavior for VS4 through reversible Faradic redox reactions and pre-dominant electrical double-layer capacitive behavior for MXene due to intercalation/de-intercalation of ions. The diffusion energy barrier for electrolytic ions is lower in VS4 (only 0.17\\xa0eV) satisfying better and rapid transport of charge carriers generated in VS4 justifying high charge storage performance. Populated electronic states for V 3d orbital in both the valence band and conduction band justify superior redox-type behavior for VS4 supporting experimental observations.Graphical abstract\\n\\nEnhanced energy storage performance of asymmetric supercapacitors based on VS4 and MXene.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Two-dimensional (2D) MXenes are a rapid growing family of 2D materials with rich physical and chemical properties where their surface termination plays an essential role. Among the various 2D MXenes, functionalization of the ${\\\\mathrm{Ti}}_{n}{\\\\mathrm{C}}_{n\\\\ensuremath{-}1}$ phase with oxygen (O) atoms makes them attractive for optoelectronic applications due to their optical gap residing in the infrared or visible region. In this paper, we theoretically investigate the electronic and optical properties of four different O-atom-functionalized ${\\\\mathrm{Ti}}_{n}{\\\\mathrm{C}}_{n\\\\ensuremath{-}1}$ MXene monolayers using state-of-the-art, first-principles techniques. In particular, we calculate the quasiparticle corrections on top of density functional theory (DFT) with the GW approximation and the exciton-dominated optical spectra by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation also at finite momentum. We find that all but one of the monolayer models are indirect band-gap semiconductors where quasiparticle corrections are very important ($\\\\ensuremath{\\\\sim}1$ eV). The optical spectra are instead dominated by direct and indirect excitons with large binding energies (between 0.5 and 1 eV). Most direct excitons lie above 1.5 eV, while the indirect ones are below; therefore, we conclude that ${\\\\mathrm{Ti}}_{n}{\\\\mathrm{C}}_{n\\\\ensuremath{-}1}$ should display strong absorption in the visible region, but phonon-assisted emission in the infrared. Our work thus reveals the potential usage of surface terminations to tune the optical and electronic properties of ${\\\\mathrm{Ti}}_{n}{\\\\mathrm{C}}_{n\\\\ensuremath{-}1}$ MXene monolayers, while emphasizing the pivotal role of many-body effects beyond DFT to obtain accurate prediction for these systems.',\n",

Here, fluorine-free exfoliation and functionalization of tantalum carbide MAX-phase to synthesize a novel Ta4C3Tx MXene-tantalum oxide (TTO) hybrid structure through an innovative, facile, and inexpensive protocol is demonstrated.

Furthermore, TTO shows excellent biocompatibility with human-induced pluripotent stem cells-derived cardiomyocytes, neural progenitor cells, fibroblasts, and mesenchymal stem cells. More importantly, the electrochemical data show that TTO outperforms most of the previously reported biomaterials-based supercapacitors in terms of gravimetric/volumetric energy and power densities.

Yet, poor energy transport through such 2D–2D and 2D–3D interfaces can limit a device's performance due to overheating. One long-standing question in the field is how different encapsulating layers (e.g., contact metals or gate oxides) contribute to the thermal transport at the interface of 2D materials with their 3D substrates. Here, a novel self-heating/self-sensing electrical thermometry platform is developed based on atomically thin, metallic Ti3C2 MXene sheets, which enables experimental investigation of the thermal transport at a Ti3C2/SiO2 interface, with and without an aluminum oxide (AlOx) encapsulating layer. It is found that at room temperature, the thermal boundary conductance (TBC) increases from 10.8 to 19.5 MW m−2 K−1 upon AlOx encapsulation. Boltzmann transport modeling reveals that the TBC can be understood as a series combination of an external resistance between the MXene and the substrate, due to the coupling of low-frequency flexural acoustic (ZA) phonons to substrate modes, and an internal resistance between ZA and in-plane phonon modes. It is revealed that internal resistance is a bottle-neck to heat removal and that encapsulation speeds up the heat transfer into low-frequency ZA modes and reduces their depopulation, thus increasing the effective TBC.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In this work, we apply an amine-assisted silica pillaring method to create the first example of a porous Mo2TiC2 MXene with nanoengineered interlayer distances. The pillared Mo2TiC2 has a surface area of 202 m2 g-1, which is among the highest reported for any MXene, and has a variable gallery height between 0.7 and 3 nm. The expanded interlayer distance leads to significantly enhanced cycling performance for Li-ion storage, with superior capacities, rate capabilities and cycling stabilities in comparison to the non-pillared version. The pillared Mo2TiC2 achieved capacities over 1.7 times greater than multilayered MXene at 20 mA g-1 (≈ 320 mAh g-1) and 2.5 times higher at 1 A g-1 (≈ 150 mAh g-1). The fast-charging properties of pillared Mo2TiC2 are further demonstrated by outstanding stability even at 1 A g-1 (under 8 min charge time), retaining 80% of the initial capacity after 500 cycles. Furthermore, we use a combination of spectroscopic techniques (i.e. XPS, NMR and Raman) to show unambiguously that the charge storage mechanism of this MXene occurs by a conversion reaction through the formation of Li2O. This reaction increases by 2-fold the capacity beyond intercalation, and therefore, its understanding is crucial for further development of this family of compounds. In addition, we also investigate for the first time the sodium storage properties of the pillared and non-pillared Mo2TiC2.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\n\\nMXenes, a novel family of 2D materials, are energy materials that have gained considerable attention, particularly for their catalytic applications in emerging areas such as CO2 and N2 hydrogenation. Herein, for the first time, it is shown that the surface reducibility of Ti3C2Tx MXene can be tuned by N doping, which induces a change in the catalytic properties of supported Co nanoparticles. Pristine Co–Ti3C2Tx MXene favors CO production during CO2 hydrogenation, whereas CH4 production is favored when the MXene is subjected to simple N doping. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) reveal that surface rutile TiO2 nanoparticles appear on the Ti3C2Tx support upon N doping, which interact strongly with the supported Co nanoparticles. This interaction alters the reducibility of the supported Co nanoparticles at the interface with the TiO2 nanoparticles, shifting the product selectivity from CO to CH4. This study successfully showcases a practical strategy, based on surface chemistry modulation of 2D MXenes, for regulating product distribution in CO2 hydrogenation.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Abstract\\n\\n2D transition metal carbides and nitrides, named MXenes, are attracting increasing attentions and showing competitive performance in energy storage devices including electrochemical capacitors, lithium- and sodium-ion batteries, and lithium–sulfur batteries. However, similar to other 2D materials, MXene nanosheets are inclined to stack together, limiting the device performance. In order to fully utilize MXenes' electrochemical energy storage capability, here, processing of 2D MXene flakes into hollow spheres and 3D architectures via a template method is reported. The MXene hollow spheres are stable and can be easily dispersed in solvents such as water and ethanol, demonstrating their potential applications in environmental and biomedical fields as well. The 3D macroporous MXene films are free-standing, flexible, and highly conductive due to good contacts between spheres and metallic conductivity of MXenes. When used as anodes for sodium-ion storage, these 3D MXene films exhibit much improved performances compared to multilayer MXenes and MXene/carbon nanotube hybrid architectures in terms of capacity, rate capability, and cycling stability. This work demonstrates the importance of MXene electrode architecture on the electrochemical performance and can guide future work on designing high-performance MXene-based materials for energy storage, catalysis, environmental, and biomedical applications.\",\n",

However, difficulties in thorough water purification and poor fouling resistance in practical applications are some of the major concerns associated to membrane-based water purification. In the present investigation, a combination of efficient and environmentally friendly photocatalysis technology has been adopted for the fabrication of a series of BiOCl-PPy@MXene multifunctional photocatalytic composite membranes by stacking MXene nanosheets and BiOCl-PPy photocatalytic nanoparticles on polyethersulfone (PES) substrates. The composite membranes with BiOCl-PPy nanoparticles exhibited excellent permeation performance with pure water (flux of 3680.2\\xa0L\\xa0m−2\\xa0h−1). Moreover, the composite membranes achieved 99.9% of combined removal rate for three different dyes and 96% for antibiotic (Tetracycline Hydrochloride) by physical sieving and photocatalytic degradation. The self-cleaning mechanism of composite membranes maintained good long-term permeability and selectivity during the cyclic tests. Hence, the service life of the membrane under visible light irradiation has been significantly improved without any compromise on the membrane performance. The density functional theory (DFT) calculation has been utilized to understand the mechanism in enhancing the photocatalytic activity of the composite membrane.Graphical abstractDownload : Download high-res image (484KB)Download : Download full-size image',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In this study, one of the commonly used MXene (Ti3C2Tx) and β nucleated isotactic polypropylene (β-iPP)/MXene composites of different compositions were fabricated. The effects of MXene on non-isothermal crystallization and polymorphic behavior of β-iPP/MXene composites were comparatively studied. The non-isothermal crystallization kinetics indicates that for all samples, the lower cooling rates promote composites to crystallize at higher temperatures. When MXene and β-Nucleating agent (β-NA) are added separately, the crystallization temperature of composites shifts towards higher temperatures at all cooling rates. When MXene and β-NA are added simultaneously, the composite shows different cooling rate dependence, and the effects of improving crystallization temperatures is more obvious under rapid cooling. The activation energy of four samples iPP, iPP/MXene, iPP/β-NA, and iPP/MXene/β-NA were −167.5, −185.5, −233.8, and −218.1 kJ/mol respectively, which agree with the variation tendency of crystallization temperatures. The polymorphic behavior analysis obtained from Differential Scanning calorimetry (DSC) is affected by two factors: the ability to form β-crystals and the thermal stability of β-crystals. Because β-crystals tend to recrystallize to α-crystals below a critical temperature, to eliminate the effect of β-α recrystallization, the melting curves at end temperatures Tend = 50 °C and Tend = 100 °C are comparatively studied. The results show that more thermally unstable β-crystals would participate in β-α recrystallization with higher cooling rates. Moreover, thermal stability of β-crystals is improved by adding MXene. To further verify these findings, samples of three different thermal conditions were synthesized and analyzed by DSC, X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), and Polarized Light Optical Microscopy (PLOM), and the results were consistent with the above findings. New understandings of synthesizing β-iPP/MXene composites with adjustable morphologies and polymorphic behavior were proposed.',\n",

Transition metal (TM) surface modification and strain engineering are found to be efficient strategies with synergistic effect to achieve efficient electrochemical HER of functionalized Mo2C, which opens up new possibilities for finding efficient and inexpensive catalysts.\\n         \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAbstract\\n\\nThe 2D MXenes have attracted great recent attention as the electrocatalytic materials for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, the activity and the modification strategy of the catalytic properties have not been firmly established yet. In this study, we performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the stability and HER performance of functionalized Mo2C MXene. The Pourbaix diagram indicates the fully oxidized surface is the most stable state. The oxidized Mo2CO2 is electrically conductive, yet the surface HER activity is unsatisfactory owing to the strong first H adsorption. The doping of transition metals (TM) into the Mo lattice, however, leads to much more enhanced H adsorption and deteriorates the activity. Alternatively, the H binding can be effectively weakened and flexibly tuned by anchoring the TM atoms over the surface with appropriate coverage, and Mn/Fe decoration at 12.5\\u2009% ML (monolayer) coverage is identified as the promising candidates with close to zero Gibbs free energy of H adsorption (ΔGH*) for the first H adsorption. The weakening effect arises from charge transfer from TM to surface O, resulting in increased occupancy and weakened O−H bonds. Furthermore, contrary to the weakening effect, the tensile strain leads to enhanced O−H binding by the up-shifted Op electronic states, which can further modulate the HER performance of TM-modified Mo2CO2. The synergistic effect between TM modification and strain engineering offers beneficial advantages for the realization of efficient electrochemical HER, which can be applied to other MXenes for electronic and catalytic applications.',\n",

On the basis of the novel electrocatalytic activity, Ti3C2Tx MXene was combined with alkaline phosphatase to construct a novel cascading catalytic amplification strategy using 1-naphthyl phosphate (1-NPP) as substrate, thereby realizing efficient electrochemical signal amplification. Taking advantage of the novel cascading catalytic amplification strategy, an electrochemical biosensor was fabricated for BCR/ABL fusion gene detection, which achieved excellent sensitivity with linear range from 0.2 fM to 20\\xa0nM and limit of detection down to 0.05 fM. This biosensor provided a promising tool for ultrasensitive fusion gene detection in early diagnosis of chronic myelogenous leukemia and acute lymphocytic leukemia. Moreover, the manageable catalytic activity of MXene broke a path for developing nanozymes, which possessed enormous application potential in not only electrochemical analysis but also the extensive fields including organic synthesis, pollutant disposal and so on.\\n                Graphical Abstract',\n",

In this study, we present all-printed, sustainable wearable TENGs based on electron accumulation polymers (EAPs) with superior charge retention capability. EAPs consisting of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), and Ti3C2Tx (MXene) in a fluorinated polymer matrix, are used. Compared to the reference, the EAPs not only lead to approximately six times higher output performance (300 V and 40 μA) but also four times more sustainable charge retention capability (92%) for an hour. These are attributed to the three-step electron-trapping mechanism with electron transfer/transport from PTFE/SWCNT and electron trapping in MXene.

This study shows for the first time surface engineering and functionalization of 2D Ti3C2 MXene nanosheets by the integration of GdW10-based polyoxometalates (POMs). These multifunctional GdW10@Ti3C2 composite nanosheets provide hyperthermal treatment with magnetic resonance (MR) and/or computed tomography (CT) imaging guidance toward tumor cells or xenografts. A tumor was effectively eradicated without further reoccurrence during the observation period. GdW10 nanoclusters that were integrated onto the surface of Ti3C2 nanosheets were demonstrated to serve as a contrast agent for contrast-enhanced CT and MR imaging based on their unique composition, thus showing the potential for diagnostic-imaging guidance and monitoring for tumor hyperthermia nanotherapy. The high in vivo biocompatibility of GdW10@Ti3C2 composite nanosheets was demonstrated to guarantee their subsequent translation into a medical treatment.

The microstructures of IL/PVDF and MXene-IL/PVDF MMMs were characterized by TEM, SEM, FTIR, XRD, and XPS analysis. The performance of the MMMs was evaluated in the dead-end filtration, and results showed that IL addition would increase the pore size and hydrophilicity of IL/PVDF MMMs, thereby enhancing water flux and anti-fouling performance of the MMMs. However, IL would be dissolved out from IL/PVDF MMMs during the filtration process, which would depress the flux recovery rate of the MMMs. For MXene-IL/PVDF MMMs, IL was encapsulated by intercalating into the MXene nanosheets and effectively prevented the loss of IL from Mxene-IL/PVDF MMMs in the running process. MXene-IL/PVDF MMMs had high water flux and antifouling performance, and the maximum flux recovery rate of MXene-IL co-incorporated PVDF MMMs reached 96% after four-cycle filtration, and the corresponding water flux was 129.37 L·m-2·h-1.

These challenges typically stem from bottom-up approaches limiting the production to the substrate size or precursor availability for chemical synthesis and/or exfoliation. In contrast, MXenes, a large class of 2D transition metal carbides and/or nitrides, are produced via a top-down synthesis approach. The selective wet etching process does not have similar synthesis constraints as some other 2D materials. The reaction occurs in the whole volume; therefore, the process can be readily scaled with reactor volume. Herein, the synthesis of 2D titanium carbide MXene (Ti3C2Tx) is studied in two batch sizes, 1 and 50\\u2009g, to determine if large-volume synthesis affects the resultant structure or composition of MXene flakes. Characterization of the morphology and properties of the produced MXene using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, dynamic light scattering, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, UV–visible spectroscopy, and conductivity measurements show that the materials produced in both batch sizes are essentially identical. This illustrates that MXenes experience no change in structure or properties when scaling synthesis, making them viable for further scale-up and commercialization.',\n",

However, the resulting structures, properties, and performances have been directly related to how the material is synthesized or processed. This chapter serves as an introduction to the current top-down chemical etching methods used to synthesize MXenes, such as fluoride-containing aqueous etchant solutions, molten-salt etching procedures, and alkaline or hydrothermal treatments. Emphasis is given to selective etching from aluminum-containing layered precursors; however, insight into selective etching of other A elements (gallium, silicon, etc.) is discussed. The latter half of the chapter is devoted to reviewing large-scale production and processing methods, general processing and properties which should be expected after each synthesis or deposition route, an overview of current challenges, and a perspective for the future of 2D MXenes.KeywordsSelective etchingMXenesSynthesisProcessingLarge-scale productionTwo-dimensional materials',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Similar to other two-dimensional (2D) materials, single-layer and few-layer MXene flakes have significantly different physiochemical properties compared to their multilayered counterparts. 2D MXene flakes offer high surface area to volume ratio, tunable functional surfaces, high electrical conductivity, and excellent mechanical properties. These properties have rendered different MXene compositions as promising materials for a wide variety of applications, such as electrochemical energy storage devices, electromagnetic interference shielding, water purification, and sensors, to name a few. MXenes are usually produced through a selective etching and liquid exfoliation process in which “A” layer atoms of MAX phases, a large group of ternary carbides and nitrides, is selectively removed in fluoride containing acidic solutions. This process, in most cases, results in multilayered MXene particles (stacks of many single-layer MXene flakes) that need to be delaminated to produce single/few layer flakes. Delamination of multilayered MXenes usually involves chemical intercalation of MXenes with large organic molecules to increase their interlayer spacing, and therefore, significantly reducing the attraction between individual MXene layers. For some MXenes, intercalated particles can be readily delaminated to individual flakes by rigorous shaking or weak sonication of their water dispersions. For some MXenes, such as Ti3C2Tx, the synthesis process has evolved over the past few years and through modification of the etchants, the etching and delamination steps are combined into a single process, and the exfoliated MXenes can be directly delaminated into single-layer flakes. This chapter provides a comprehensive account of various MXene exfoliation and delamination techniques reported in the literature so far. At the end of this chapter, we have briefly discussed the current challenges and potential future directions in delamination of different MXenes into their single-layer flakes.KeywordsDelaminationSingle-layerTwo-dimensional (2D)MXeneMethods',\n",

By introducing CNFs, the mechanical strength, flexibility of the composite film, and sensitive to the temperature change and strain are improved.

At the optimized CNFs/MXene ratio of 2/5, the transferred charges and output voltage reach the maximum value of 7.4\\xa0nC and 24.9\\xa0V, respectively. The maximum instantaneous output power density of the as-prepared TENG is 1.2\\xa0mW\\xa0m−2.

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\n\\nLayered MXene films have shown enormous potential for wide applications due to their high electrical conductivity and unique laminated microstructure. However, the intrinsic susceptibility to oxidation and the mechanical fragility of MXene films are the two major bottlenecks that prevent their widespread industrial applications. Here, a facile yet efficient assembly strategy is proposed to address these issues by increasing the alignment and compactness of MXene layers as well as strengthening the interlayer interactions. This method involves the gelation of MXene flakes with a multifunctional inorganic “mortar” polymer (ammonium polyphosphate, APP) followed by quasi-solid-state assembly enabled by a mechanical rolling process, by which the 3D gel network is transformed into 2D freestanding MXene films with unprecedented flake alignment and compactness. Besides, due to the multiple molecular-level interactions (hydrogen bonding, coordination bonding, and electrostatic force) between APP and MXene flakes, the resultant MXene-APP film (MAF) displays high mechanical strength (286.4\\xa0± 20.3\\xa0MPa) and excellent electrical conductivity (8012.4\\xa0± 325.6 S cm−1), along with remarkable environmental stability. As an application demonstration, MAF exhibits outstanding electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness with long-term durability, highlighting the great potential of this gelation-assisted assembly strategy in fabricating large-area, high-performance MXene films for diverse real-world applications.',\n",

At present, most researchers have been working to optimize the cycle performance of lithium-rich materials. In this work, we propose a surface homogenizing heterostructure coating induced by MXene modification to reduce capacity reduction and voltage decay. It can be found that the initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) increases from 77.2% for the bare electrode Li1.2Mn0.54Co0.13Ni0.13 (LMO) to 85.5% for 1.4 wt% MXene (Ti3C2Tx, Tx represents the surface terminations: OH, O, F) modified lithium-rich (TO2). Furthermore, the discharge specific capacity of the electrode at 5 C rate increased from 160.7 mAh g−1 for LMO to 200.6 mAh g−1 for TO2. More prominently, the outstanding cycle stability with capacity retention rate is 82.1% for TO2 after 200\\u2009cycles, while only 64.7% for LMO, and the average discharge voltage dropped from 0.788 to 0.468\\u2009V. In addition, the mechanism for improving the electrochemical performance is systematically studied.',\n",

Herein titanium carbide (Ti3C2) MXene is shown to be a highly efficient noble-metal-free cocatalyst with commercial titania (P25) for photocatalytic CO2 reduction.

The significantly enhanced activity is attributed to the superior electrical conductivity and charge-carrier separation ability, as well as the abundant CO2 adsorption and activation sites of surface-alkalinized Ti3C2 MXene, indicating its promise as a highly-active noble-metal-free cocatalysts for photocatalytic CO2 reduction.',\n",

Opportune lateral epitaxy of UZNs on the surface of MNs improves specific surface area, pore diameter, and hydrophilicity of the resulting materials, all of which could be beneficial to the photocatalytic activity. Owing to the Schottky junction and ultrathin 2D structures of UZNs and MNs, the heterostructures could effectively suppress photoexcited electron–hole recombination and boost photoexcited charge transfer and separation. The heterostructure photocatalyst exhibits improved photocatalytic H2 evolution performance (6.6 times higher than pristine ZnIn2S4) and excellent stability.',\n",

In order to overcome this problem and realize the full potential of MXene nanosheets, a 3D MXene foam with developed porous structure is established via a simple sulfur-template method, which is freestanding, flexible, and highly conductive, and can be directly used as the electrode in lithium-ion batteries. The 3D porous architecture of the MXene foam offers massive active sites to enhance the lithium storage capacity. Moreover, its foam structure facilitates electrolyte infiltration for fast Li+ transfer. As a result, this flexible 3D porous MXene foam exhibits significantly enhanced capacity of 455.5 mAh g−1 at 50 mA g−1, excellent rate performance (101 mAh g−1 at 18 A g−1), and superior ultralong-term cycle stability (220 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 3500 cycles). This work not only demonstrates the great superiority of the 3D porous MXene foam but also proposes the sulfur-template method for controllable constructing of the 3D foam from 2D nanosheets at a relatively low temperature.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'AbstractIn this paper, we report, for the first time, on the electrochemical catalytic activity of 2D titanium carbonitride MXene for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). According to our study, 2D titanium carbonitride exhibited much higher electrocatalytic activity than its carbide analogues, achieving an onset overpotential of 53\\xa0\\u200bmV and Tafel slope of 86\\xa0\\u200bmV dec−1, superior to the titanium carbide with onset overpotential of 649\\xa0\\u200bmV and Tafel slope of 303\\xa0\\u200bmV dec−1. The obtained onset overpotential for 2D titanium carbonitride is lower than those of all the reported transition metal carbides MXene catalysts without additives, so far. Density functional theory calculations were conducted to further understand the electrochemical performance. The calculation results show that a greater number of occupied states are active for Ti3CNO2, revealing free energy for the adsorption of atomic hydrogen closer to 0 than that of Ti3C2O2. Both experimental and calculation studies demonstrate the excellent electrocatalytic behavior of titanium carbonitride. The investigation of 2D titanium carbonitride opens up a promising paradigm for the conscious design of high-performance non-precious metal catalyst for hydrogen generation.Graphical abstractDownload : Download high-res image (238KB)Download : Download full-size image',\n",

In particular, Li+-, Na+-, and K+-based cation transport in energy storage devices such as batteries and electrochemical capacitors is closely related to the capacitance behavior. We have exploited different sizes of cations from aqueous salt electrolytes intercalating into a layered Nb2CTx electrode in a supercapacitor for the first time. As a result, we have demonstrated that capacitive performance was dependent on cation intercalation behavior. The interlayer spacing expansion of the electrode material can be observed in Li2SO4, Na2SO4, and K2SO4 electrolytes with d-spacing. Additionally, our results showed that the Nb2CTx electrode exhibited higher electrochemical performance in the presence of Li2SO4 than in that of Na2SO4 and K2SO4. This is partly because the smaller-sized Li+ transports quickly and intercalates between the layers of Nb2CTx easily. Poor ion transport in the Na2SO4 electrolyte limited the electrode capacitance and presented the lowest electrochemical performance, although the cation radius follows Li+>Na+>K+. Our experimental studies provide direct evidence for the intercalation mechanism of Li+, Na+, and K+ on the 2D layered Nb2CTx electrode, which provides a new path for exploring the relationship between intercalated cations and other MXene electrodes.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Lithium-Sulfur batteries are of great interest owing to sulfur's high theoretical capacity, low-cost and environmental benignity. However, the practicality of these batteries has been impeded due to the infamous “polysulfide-shuttle” effect. Although several research articles in the past decade have focused to mitigate this effect, capacity fade and low coulombic efficiency still prevail. 2D MXenes are early transition metal carbides known for their high metallic conductivity with tunable surface functionalities. MXenes with formula Mn+1XnTx are usually derived from the parental MAX phases by selectively etching the A layer (where M represents a transition metal, A represents the group 13 or 14 elements in the periodic table and X represents carbon or nitrogen, Tx stands for the surface terminations). Thus, the obtained MXenes possess a unique layered structure. After etching, the surface of MXenes is terminated with various functional groups such as hydroxyl (-OH), oxygen (-O), chlorine (-Cl), and fluorine (-F).\\n               Rich surface polar sites in Ti3C2Tx enhance electrochemical performance via suppression of polysulfide shuttle. However, past synthesis procedures result in the development of hydrophilic MXene nanosheets unable to be coupled with hydrophobic sulfur. Herein, we propose a new design based on the functionalization of MXene nanosheets with an organic molecule for the effective deposition of sulfur nanoparticles on the surface. This strategy enables the dispersion of MXene sheets in sulfur dissolved solvents enabling the conformal deposition of sulfur on MXene sheets with negligible water in the composite. The metallic sheet-like conductivity (~103 S.cm-1) also aids in faster reaction kinetics during the conversion of polysulfides to Li2S, mitigating the shuttle effect. Consequently, the developed composite enables the efficient utilization of active surface sites to bind polysulfides and alleviate the shuttle effect. This novel cathode delivers a high initial reversible capacity of 1220 mAh·g-1 at 0.1 C and at 0.5C, these cathodes stabilize at 880mAh·g-1 after the first 5 cycles, 85% of which is retained post 500 cycles. Additionally, we developed cathodes with high sulfur loading of ~10.7 mg·cm-2 that delivers a stable areal capacity of ~7 mAh·cm-2 for 150 cycles. Moreover, these cathodes in a pouch cell configuration retained ~770 mAh·g-1 after ~200 cycles at 0.2C (85.5% retention). Ex-situ studies elucidated the nature of the LiPs–MXene interaction and the effect of surface functionalization towards improved performance\\n               \\n                  \\n                     +RP and VN have equal contribution\",\n",

In this paper, we report that double metallic co-catalysts Ti3C2 MXene and metallic octahedral (1T) phase tungsten disulfide (WS2) act pathways transferring photoexcited electrons in assisting the photocatalytic H2 evolution. TiO2 nanosheets were in situ grown on highly conductive Ti3C2 MXenes and 1T-WS2 nanoparticles were then uniformly distributed on TiO2@Ti3C2 composite. Thus, a distinctive 1T-WS2@TiO2@Ti3C2 composite with double metallic co-catalysts was achieved, and the content of 1T phase reaches 73%. The photocatalytic H2 evolution performance of 1T-WS2@TiO2@Ti3C2 composite with an optimized 15 wt% WS2 ratio is nearly 50 times higher than that of TiO2 nanosheets because of conductive Ti3C2 MXene and 1T-WS2 resulting in the increase of electron transfer efficiency. Besides, the 1T-WS2 on the surface of TiO2@Ti3C2 composite enhances the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area and boosts the density of active site.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'We unravel the evolution of structural, electronic, magnetic, and topological properties of graphene-like pristine, defected, and strained titanium nitride MXene with different functional groups (-F, -O, -H, and -OH) employing first-principles calculations. The formation and cohesive energies reveal their chemical stability. The MAX phase and defect free functionalized MXenes are metallic in nature except for oxygen terminated one, which is 100% spin polarized half-metallic. Additionally, the bare MXene is nearly half-metallic ferromagnet. The spin-orbit coupling significantly influences the bare MXene possessing band inversion. The strain effect sways the Fermi level thereby shifting it toward lower energy state under compression and toward higher energy state under tensile strain in Ti2NH2. These properties are reversed in Ti2N, Ti2NF2, and Ti2N(OH)2. The half-metallic nature changes to semi-metallic under 1% compression and is completely destroyed under 2% compression. In single vacancy defect, the band structure of Ti2NO2 remarkably transforms from half-metallic to semi-conducting (with large band gap of 1.73 eV) in 12.5% Ti, weakly semi-conducting in 5.5% Ti, and topological semi-metal in 12.5% oxygen. The 25% N defect changes the half-metallic to the metallic with certain topological features. Further, the 12.5% Co substitution in Ti2NO2 preserves the half-metallic character, whereas Mn substitution allows to convert half-metallic into weak semi-metallic preserving ferromagnetic character. However, Cr substitution converts half-metallic ferromagnetic to half-metallic anti-ferromagnetic state. The understanding made here on collective structural stability, and magnetic and topological phenomena in novel 2D MXenes open up their possibility in designing them for synthesis and thereby taking to applications.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\n\\nRoom temperature volatile organic compounds (VOCs) sensors usually suffer from severe humidity interference and insufficient sensitivity against VOCs, which greatly restricts its practical applications. Herein, the authors simultaneously reduce the hydrophilicity while improving the VOCs sensitivity of Ti3C2Tx MXene by introducing hydrocarbon terminations. The termination-modified Ti3C2Tx (Ti3C2Tx-M2) sensor demonstrates fivefold enhancement in ethanol sensitivity at room temperature, while response against water vapor has been reduced by 71% compared with pristine Ti3C2Tx. In addition, the modification also contributes to the arrest of sensor degradation that refines the sensing stability. On this basis, the MXene-based VOCs sensor is employed for in situ, real-time monitoring of exhaled ethanol as a proof-of-concept by integrating it with a wearable detection tag. Owing to the suppressed humidity interference and amplified VOCs response, the Ti3C2Tx-M2 sensor could dynamically track the exhaled ethanol variations after alcohol intake. This work not only demonstrates a facile modification strategy to promote the sensitivities of MXene-based VOCs sensor, but also a promising scheme for facile breath analysis, shedding lights on MXene-based wearable medical electronics and intelligent healthcare.',\n",

For the evaluation of the adhesive strength of the free-standing Ti3C2Tz-based film, the model comprised single-layered MXene nanosheets with a specific number of individual flakes, and the reverse engineering method with a curve fitting approach was used. The interlaminar shear strength, in-plane stiffness, and shear energy release rate of MXene film were predicted using this approach. The results of the sensitivity analysis showed that interlaminar shear strength and in-plane stiffness have the largest influence on the mechanical behavior of MXene film under tension, while the shear energy release rate mainly affects the interlaminar damage properties of nanosheets.',\n",

The Ti3C2Tx/WSe2 hybrid sensor exhibits low noise level, ultrafast response/recovery times, and good flexibility for various volatile organic compounds. The sensitivity of the hybrid sensor to ethanol is improved by over 12-fold in comparison with pristine Ti3C2Tx.

MXene has boosted the performance of supercapacitors thanks to its pseudocapacitive charge storage mechanism with electric double layer behavior. Further, MXene has helped batteries achieve high capacity while endowing fast charge-discharge by virtue of its suitable interlayer spacing and unique chemistry. Such achievements are a result of MXene’s intrinsic properties like high electrical conductivity, defined layered structure and ability to sustain customizations, tailoring the electrodes towards a specific target. Not only that, MXene has showcased its merits by enabling supercapacitors and batteries to surpass the convention and venture into the territory of micro-supercapacitors (MSCs), hybrid capacitors and batteries beyond Li-ion.

Such a hybrid membrane has a high magnetization of 18.9 emu/g. When MXene (Ti3C2Tx) layers are further loaded on the TPU/PAN/Fe3O4NPs hybrid membrane, its EMI SE performance in the X band can exceed 30 dB due to the hydrogen bonds generated between the macromolecular chain of PAN and the functional group (Tx) on the surface of MXene. Simultaneously, the interfacial attraction between MXene and the TPU/PAN/Fe3O4NPs substrate is enhanced.

Herein, a facile strategy is reported for tailoring the electrocatalytic performance of a low-Pt catalyst over a wide range of pH conditions using multilevel hollow MXene with sufficient diffusion channels, multiple reactive surface areas, and robust frameworks with high conductivity and hydrophilic and aggregation resistance. Their synergy with ultrafine Pt creates efficient multifunctional catalytic interfaces with high Pt utilization, and overall enhanced charge transport, H+/water adsorption activation, intermediate H binding, and ionic/mass exchange. The resultant catalyst fully exceeds the commercial 20% Pt/C by 10–20 folds in mass activity for hydrogen evolution through the full pH range. The highest mass activity of 12.94 A mgPt−1 is achieved in an alkaline electrolyte with 1/8 Pt usage of 20% Pt/C. This catalyst also exhibits the best combination of high activity, long lifetime (250 h, 31 times of Pt/C), and nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency among 20% Pt/C (8 h) and documented electrocatalysts (10–100 h) for hydrogen production in natural seawater.

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\n\\nSulfur (S) is an attractive cathode material with advantages including high theoretical capacity and low cost. However, issues such as the lithium polysulfide shuttle effect and its insulating properties greatly limit the future applications of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Here, a viscous aqueous ink with nanoscale S uniformly decorated on the polar, metallically conductive titanium carbide MXene nanosheets (S@Ti3C2Tx) is reported to address these issues. Importantly, it is observed that the conductive Ti3C2Tx mediator efficiently chemisorbs the soluble polysulfides and converts them into thiosulfate/sulfate. The in situ formed sulfate complex layer acts as a thick protective barrier, which significantly retards the shuttling of polysulfides upon cycling and improves the sulfur utilization. Consequently, the binder-free, robust, highly electrically conductive composite film exhibits outstanding electrochemical performance, including high capacities (1244–1350 mAh g-1), excellent rate handling, and impressive cycling stability (0.035–0.048% capacity loss per cycle), surpassing the best MXene-S batteries known. The fabrication of a pouch cell based on the freestanding S@Ti3C2Tx film is also reported. The prototype device showcases high capacities and excellent mechanical flexibility. Considering the broad family of MXenes and their unique roles in immobilizing the polysulfides, various S@MXene composites can be similarly fabricated with promising Li+ storage capability and long lifetime performance.',\n",

This work demonstrates the fabrication of organic-inorganic composites by deposition of supramolecular aggregates of a chlorophyll derivative, namely, zinc methyl 3-devinyl-3-hydroxymethyl-pyropheophorbide a (Chl) on the surface of Ti3C2Tx MXene with 2D accordion-like morphology. This composite material is employed as noble metal-free catalyst in photocatalytic HER under the white light illumination, where Chl serves as a small molecule organic semiconductor component instead of ordinary inorganic and polymer organic semiconductors such as TiO2 and g-C3N4, and Ti3C2Tx serves as a co-catalyst. Different composition ratios of Chl/Ti3C2Tx are compared for their light-harvesting ability, morphology, charge transfer efficiency, and photocatalytic performance. The best HER performance is found to be as high as 52 ± 5 µmol h−1 gcat−1 after optimization. Such a large HER activity is attributed to the efficient light harvesting followed by exciton transfer in Chl aggregates and the resultant charge separation at the interface of Chl/Ti3C2Tx.',\n",

This was confirmed by micro computed tomography (micro-CT) visualization which enables insight into the porous structure of nanocomposites.

However, the gelation of MXenes, another important type of 2D materials that have different surface chemistry from GO, is difficult to achieve. Here, the first gelation of MXenes in an aqueous dispersion that is initiated by divalent metal ions is reported, where the strong interaction between these ions and \\uf8ffOH groups on the MXene surface plays a key role. Typically, Fe2+ ions are introduced in the MXene dispersion which destroys the electrostatic repulsion force between the MXene nanosheets in the dispersion and acts as linkers to bond the nanosheets together, forming a 3D MXene network. The obtained hydrogel effectively avoids the restacking of the MXene nanosheets and greatly improves their surface utilization, resulting in a high rate performance when used as a supercapacitor electrode (≈226 F g−1 at 1 V s−1). It is believed that the gelation of MXenes indicates a new way to build various tunable MXene-based structures and develop different applications.',\n",

So, it is necessary to improve the mechanical property of fiber-reinforced PP composites. In this present, two-dimensional Ti3C2 Mxene nanosheets were bound to short aramid fiber (SAF), forming Ti3C2 nanosheets-modified SAF (Ti3C2/SAF), aiming to improve PP mechanical property. The Ti3C2 nanosheets were obtained after hydrofluoric acid etching and ultrasonically delamination procedure, followed by chemically bound to the surface of H3PO4 solution-treated SAF to form Ti3C2/SAF. The Ti3C2/SAF-reinforced PP (Ti3C2/SAF/PP) composites were prepared by a melt blending method. Scanning electron microscopy images showed that the Ti3C2/SAF modified with different concentration of Ti3C2 nanosheets solution presented the distinct morphologies, with the 0.3 mg/ml Ti3C2/SAF formed a relatively uniform Ti3C2 nanosheets coating on the SAF surface. Test results of mechanical performance indicated that the tensile and impact strength of Ti3C2/SAF/PP composites were significantly improved. Especially, the maximum tensile and impact strength of 0.3 Ti3C2/SAF/PP composite at 5 wt% reached to 37.8 MPa and 14.0 kJ/m2, which was increased by 11.5% (or 28.1%) in tensile strength and 12.9% (or 38.6%) in impact strength, compared with that of SAF/PP composite (or PP matrix). This can be attributed that Ti3C2 nanosheets binding to SAF improved the interfacial bonding strength between SAF and PP. This work provides a promising strategy for improving the mechanical properties of fiber-reinforced PP composites.',\n",

Herein, redox kinetics and duration are significantly boosted by introducing a Nb2CTX host that is classified as a layered 2D Nb-based MXene. With a facile electrodeposition strategy, initial I− ions are electrically driven to insert in the nanosized interlayers and are electro-oxidized in situ. Linear I2 is firmly confined inside and benefits from the rapid charge supply from the MXene. Consequently, an aqueous Zn battery based on a Zn metal anode and ZnSO4 electrolyte delivers an ultraflat plateau at 1.3\\xa0V, which contributes to 84.5% of the capacity and 89.1% of the energy density. Record rate capability (143 mAh g−1 at 18 A g−1) and lifespan (23\\xa0000) cycles are achieved, which are far superior to those of all reported aqueous MXenes and I2–metal batteries. Moreover, the low voltage decay rate of 5.6\\xa0mV h−1 indicates its superior anti-self-discharge properties. Physicochemical analyses and density functional theory calculations elucidate that the localized electron transfer and trapping effect of the Nb2CTX MXene host are responsible for enhanced kinetics and suppressed shuttle behavior. This work can be extended to the fabrication of other I2–metal batteries with long-life-time expectations.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'AbstractTwo-dimensional (2D) materials were widely used in sensing owing to the tunable physical or chemical properties. For years, optical sensing attracted a massive amount of attention on account of high accuracy, high security, non-invasive measurement, and strong anti-interference ability. Among the various optical sensing schemes, multi-wavelength optical sensing (MWOS) is an important branch and widely adopted in optical image, spectroscopy, or bio/chemical research. However, no spectral selectivity, limited working wavelength range, or intrinsic instability makes conventional 2D materials unsuitable for MWOS. A new class of 2D materials, known as MXene, exhibits outstanding electronic, optical, and thermal properties, leading to new applications in optical sensing. In this paper, we propose an integrated photothermal optical sensor (PHOS) using Ti3C2Tx MXene films. Thanks to the inherent spectral dependence of Ti3C2Tx MXene over a broadband range, the proposed PHOS can respond to different wavelengths from visible to short-wavelength infrared. Because of the efficient photothermal conversion, the PHOS has a control efficiency up to 0.19 π\\u2009·\\u2009mW−1\\u2009·\\u2009mm−1 under 980-nm laser pumping and shows a higher control efficiency under red light (690 nm) irradiation.

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract. Malignant mesothelioma is an aggressive and deadly form of cancer that develops in the thin layer of tissue surrounding the majority of internal organs (mesothelium). Malignant mesothelioma has no known cure and has a very poor prognosis because of late diagnosis and limited usefulness of standard treatments. We are exploring newer treatments to tackle this deadly disease. Photothermal therapy is an emerging noninvasive spatiotemporal selective therapeutic strategy that employs near-infrared photoabsorbers to generate heat for thermal ablation of cancer cells. The therapeutic efficacy of photothermal therapy significantly depends on the transformation of light to sufficient heat with photothermal agents. MXene Ti3C2 is an effective two-dimensional light-to-heat conversion material. The internal light-to-heat conversion efficiency of MXene Ti3C2 was measured to be 100%, indicating a perfect energy conversion. In this study we report for the first time using the MXene Ti3C2 nanoplatform as a photothermal agent to efficiently ablate malignant mesothelioma. First, we prepared two-dimensional MXene Ti3C2 and UV-vis-NIR spectrum showed Ti3C2 has a strong absorbance at the region of 790 nm, which showed a high light extinction coefficient of 26.081 L g-1cm-1 and exhibited a good photothermal conversion efficiency of 22%. Photothermal heating curves show temperatures of different concentration of MXene Ti3C2 increase steadily with irradiation of 808nm laser. Recycling heating profiles demonstrate that MXene Ti3C2 can be repeatedly heated stably. Next, the effects of MXene Ti3C2 on normal and mesothelioma cell lines were tested with CellTiter-Glo® luminescent cell viability assays. MXene Ti3C2 has no toxicity to cells at the tested concentration range. Light microscopy revealed that MXene Ti3C2 can accumulate inside of mesothelioma cells but not in normal cells. There was no red blood cell hemolysis within the tested concentration range and the hemolysis ratio was 0.5% even at ten times higher than the test concentration. Then, normal and mesothelioma cells were treated with and without MXene Ti3C2 for 24~48 hours followed by laser irradiation. CellTiter-Glo® luminescent cell viability assays and colony formation assays validated that MXene Ti3C2-treated mesothelioma cells were eliminated by laser irradiation while normal cells and nontreated mesothelioma were spared. Flow cytometry and Western blot analysis were used for determination of apoptosis. Lastly, we established a mesothelioma mouse xenograft model to evaluate the therapeutic effect of MXene Ti3C2 on mesothelioma in vivo. We are also pursuing the combination of MXene Ti3C2-based photothermal therapy and current therapies for mesothelioma. Our results indicate that MXene Ti3C2 is a promising photothermal agent in therapy of mesothelioma.Citation Format: Lanlan Zhou, Fayan Meng, Babak Anasori, Yury Gogotsi, Wafik S. El-Deiry.

Commonly used etching methods usually introduce -F surface terminations or metallic impurities in MXene. We present a new molten-salt-assisted electrochemical etching method to synthesize fluorine-free Ti3C2Cl2. Using electrons as reaction agents, cathode reduction and anode etching can be spatially isolated; thus, no metallics are present in the Ti3C2Cl2 product. The surface terminations can be in situ modified from −Cl to −O and/or −S, which considerably shortens the modification steps and enriches the variety of surface terminations. The obtained −O-terminated Ti3C2Tx are excellent electrode materials for supercapacitors, exhibiting capacitances of 225\\u2005F\\u2009g−1 at 1.0\\u2005Ag−1, good rate performance (91.1\\u2009% at 10\\u2005Ag−1), and excellent capacitance retention (100\\u2009% after 10000 charge/discharge cycles at 10\\u2005Ag−1), which is superior to multi-layered Ti3C2Tx prepared by other etching methods.',\n",

Here, a high-performance MXene image sensor array fabricated by a wafer-scale combination patterning method of an MXene film is reported. This method combines MXene centrifugation, spin-coating, photolithography, and dry-etching and is highly compatible with mainstream semiconductor processing, with a resolution up to 2\\xa0µm, which is at least 100 times higher than other large-area patterning methods reported previously. As a result, a high-density integrated array of 1024-pixel Ti3C2Tx/Si photodetectors with a detectivity of 7.73 × 1014 Jones and a light–dark current ratio (Ilight/Idark) of 6.22 × 106, which is the ultrahigh value among all reported MXene-based photodetectors, is fabricated.

Their large specific surface area and the tunability of their physicochemical properties as a function of the transition metal and surface terminal group make them a unique design platform for various applications, a primary example of which is pseudocapacitive energy storage. However, there is still incomplete understanding of how the transition metal chemistry and stoichiometry, and the surface termination affect charge storage mechanisms in MXene. In this study, we have performed systematic first-principles calculations for bulk MXene and found that the atomic charge of the metal cations, which is related to their valence, decreases across the d-electron metal series. Electronic-structure indicators of performance are examined to understand the energy storage behavior, whereby charges are stored between the terminal groups and adsorbing cations. Importantly, we found that the differential Bader charges show good agreement with theoretical capacitances and are useful in predicting charge storage trends in MXene-based pseudocapacitors. Furthermore, we have performed first-principles and grand canonical Monte Carlo calculations for the slab systems, finding that the solvent plays a critical role in enhancing the pseudocapacitive response.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'MXene, a 2D material, is used as a filler to manufacture polymer electrolytes with high ionic conductivity because of its unique sheet shape, large specific surface area and high aspect ratio. Because MXene has numerous -OH groups on its surface, it can cause dehydration and condensation reactions with poly(4-styrenesulfonic acid) (PSSA) and consequently create pathways for the conduction of cations. The movement of Grotthuss-type hydrogen ions along the cation-conduction pathway is promoted and a high ionic conductivity can be obtained. In addition, when electrolytes composed of a conventional acid or metal salt alone is applied to an electrochromic device (ECD), it does not bring out fast response time, high coloration efficiency and transmittance contrast simultaneously. Therefore, dual-cation electrolytes are designed for high-performance ECDs. Bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amine lithium salt (LiTFSI) was used as a source of lithium ions and PSSA crosslinked with MXene was used as a source of protons. Dual-Cation electrolytes crosslinked with MXene was applied to an indium tin oxide-free, all-solution-processable ECD. The effect of applying the electrolyte to the device was verified in terms of response time, coloration efficiency and transmittance contrast. The ECD with a size of 5 × 5 cm2 showed a high transmittance contrast of 66.7%, fast response time (8 s/15 s) and high coloration efficiency of 340.6 cm2/C.',\n",

However, the relatively low intrinsic dielectric constant of dielectric polymers hinders their further applications. Herein, dielectric polymer composites were fabricated by blending with plate-barrier architecture fillers, which are comprised of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and intercalated titanium dioxide (TiO2) cubes. TiO2 cubes are homogeneously and controllably integrated onto rGO nanosheets utilizing 2D transition metal carbides (MXene) by means of shape match. TiO2 cubes could serve as joints to anchor rGO nanosheets for more effective polarization, and as barriers to impede the conductive contact of rGO nanosheets. In the nanocomposites, rGO nanosheets possess high alignment and overlap area resorting to the anchoring effect of TiO2, which increases the micro-capacitors in series that greatly enhance the dielectric constant. Therefore, it is investigated that the nanocomposites exhibit a high dielectric constant (211) and ultralow dielectric loss (0.104). Moreover, the enhancement mechanism of the micro-capacitors was also revealed by the finite element simulation. This contribution provides a novel strategy to fabricate well-aligned nanocomposites that are promising in electronics flexible materials.Graphical abstractMXene derived TiO2 cubes can serve as dielectric mediums and supporting barriers between rGO layers to form well-aligned micro-capacitors, which enable the PVDF nanocomposites to achieve excellent dielectric performance.Download : Download high-res image (370KB)Download : Download full-size image',\n",

In this article, we review the state-of-the-art computational progress on Li-ion battery applications of MXene materials in accordance with our systematical DFT calculations. Structural, mechanical, dynamical, and electrical properties of 20 distinct MXene (M: Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Nb, Mo, Hf, Ta, W, and Zr) have been discussed. The battery performances of these MXene monolayers are further investigated by Li-ion binding energies, open circuit voltage values, and Li migration energy barriers. The experimental and theoretical progress up to date demonstrates particularly the potential of non-terminated or pristine MXene materials in Li ion-storage applications. Stability analyses show most of the pristine MXenes should be achievable, however susceptible to the development progress on the experimental growth procedures. Among pristine MXenes, Ti2C, V2C, Sc2C, and Zr2C compounds excel with their high charge/discharge rate prospect due to their extremely low Li diffusion energy barriers.

Introducing an adequate substrate to disperse and anchor Pt-based species is a feasible pathway to improve the utilization efficiency.

The improved activity of Pt/MXene can be attributed to the charge transfer from Pt clusters to MXene, which weakens the hydrogen adsorption, as evidenced by the density functional theory calculations.

A MXene film could be used as an effective flexible supercapacitor electrode due to its flexibility and, more importantly, its high specific capacitance. However, although it has excellent electronic conductivity, sluggish ionic kinetics within the MXene film becomes a fundamental limitation to the electrochemical performance. To compensate for the relative deficiency, MXene films are frequently reduced to several micrometer dimensions with low mass loading (<1 mg cm−2), to the point of detriment of areal performance and commercial value. Herein, for the first time, the design of a 3D porous MXene/bacterial cellulose (BC) self-supporting film is reported for ultrahigh capacitance performance (416 F g−1, 2084 mF cm−2) with outstanding mechanical properties and high flexibility, even when the MXene loading reaches 5 mg cm−2. The highly interconnected MXene/BC network enables both excellent electron and ion transport channel. Additionally, a maximum energy density of 252 µWh cm−2 is achieved in an asymmetric supercapacitor, higher than that of all ever-reported MXene-based supercapacitors. This work exploits a simple route for assembling 2D MXene materials into 3D porous films as state-of-the-art electrodes for high performance energy storage devices.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\n\\nMXene, an example of 2D transition metal carbides, has recently been explored as an energy storage material for batteries or supercapacitors due to its high electrical conductivity and tunability of functional moieties. As with other 2D nano-materials, however, attempts to harness MXene-based electrodes have been limited by deterioration in mass transfer owing to self-stacking and aggregation problems of MXenes. Here, means of creating 3D-structured MXene films having voids of controlled size using templated co-assembly between MXene nanosheets and monodisperse colloidal particles are presented. Using a 3D-structured MXene-only film incorporating microscale voids as a thin-film electrode for Li-ion batteries yield an initial specific capacity of 435.4 mAh g−1 at a current density of 0.01 A g−1 and highly extended cyclic stability persisting 1200 cycles, approaching the reported theoretical capacity of MXene even without employing any binder or conductive species. Electrochemical analyses reveal that the improved specific capacity is attributable to enhanced contribution of pseudo-capacitive Li-storage compared to diffusion-mediated capacity, as incorporated voids tend to facilitate ionic transport into the interior region of the MXene films. Therefore, this work offers a concrete understanding to realize improved electrochemical performances of 2D nanomaterial-based electrodes, especially in the form of free-standing thin films.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\n\\n2D transition metal carbides and/or nitrides, so-called MXenes, are noted as ideal fast-charging cation-intercalation electrode materials, which nevertheless suffer from limited specific capacities. Herein, it is reported that constructing redox-active phosphorus−oxygen terminals can be an attractive strategy for Nb4C3 MXenes to remarkably boost their specific capacities for ultrafast Na+ storage. As revealed, redox-active terminals with a stoichiometric formula of PO2- display a metaphosphate-like configuration with each P atom sustaining three P\\uf8ffO bonds and one P\\uf8feO dangling bond. Compared with conventional O-terminals, metaphosphate-like terminals empower Nb4C3 (denoted PO2-Nb4C3) with considerably enriched carrier density (fourfold), improved conductivity (12.3-fold at 300 K), additional redox-active sites, boosted Nb redox depth, nondeclined Na+-diffusion capability, and buffered internal stress during Na+ intercalation/de-intercalation. Consequently, compared with O-terminated Nb4C3, PO2-Nb4C3 exhibits a doubled Na+-storage capacity (221.0 mAh g-1), well-retained fast-charging capability (4.9\\xa0min at 80% capacity retention), significantly promoted cycle life (nondegraded capacity over 2000 cycles), and justified feasibility for assembling energy−power-balanced Na-ion capacitors. This study unveils that the molecular-level design of MXene terminals provides opportunities for developing simultaneously high-capacity and fast-charging electrodes, alleviating the energy−power tradeoff typical for energy-storage devices.',\n",

To produce a sensor with both high sensitivity and wide range is still a challenging work.

Here, we determined Nb2C MXene and MoS2 to form heterojunction due to their high lattice adaptation. The unique flower-petal-like Nb2C MXene was prepared by freeze-drying, the MoS2 growing on the surface of Nb2C MXene by hydrothermal method. We applied the MoS2/Nb2C hybrids to LSB for the first time. The MoS2/Nb2C hybrids showed a specific capacity of 919.2 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C after 200 cycles with excellent retention of 92.2% when used as the cathode of LSBs.

The mechanism of excellent properties of LSBs and HER activity were explained from the perspective of adsorption energy calculated according to the first principles. The adsorption activity of the MoS2/Nb2C heterojunction is much higher than that of bare MoS2 from the point of view of lithium polysulfides (LiPS) and hydrogen atoms.

However, the notorious shuttle effect results in poor electrochemical performance, which is a serious obstacle for their practical application. The delicate design of sulfur hosts is a very important strategy to suppress the shuttle effect. Herein, MXene nanoflakes confined within multichannel carbon nanofibers (MXene@MCNF) have been successfully synthesized as robust electrocatalysts for Li–S batteries based on a simple electrospun method followed by a carbonization process. This unique structure effectively prevents the restacking of MXene nanoflakes, which is conducive to improve the electrocatalytic activity of MXene for propelling the redox reaction of polysulfides owing to the abundant exposure of surface active sites. Moreover, the multichannel hollow structure can inhibit the outward dissolution of polysulfides via the physical confinement caused by their abundant pore structures and alleviate the huge volume change of sulfur cathode. Benefiting from these aforementioned advantages, MXene@MCNF-sulfur (MXene@MCNF-S) cathode delivers a high capacity of 1177 mA h/g at 0.2 C and excellent cycling stability after 200 cycles at 2.0 C.',\n",

Moreover, the oxygen vacancies (OVs) of catalyst are highly active sites to adsorb and activate O2 during photocatalytic aerobic oxidation. However, OVs are easily blocked by oxygen atoms from active oxygen species during the catalytic process, leading to the deactivation of catalysis. Herein, a promising catalyst toward photocatalytic aerobic oxidation was successfully developed by recovering the OVs through doping Au atoms into Ti3C2Tx MXene (Au/Ti3C2Tx). Impressively, Au/Ti3C2Tx exhibited remarkable activity under full-spectrum irradiation towards photooxidation of methyl phenyl sulfide (MPS) and methylene blue (MB), attaining a conversion of >90% at room temperature. Moreover, Au/Ti3C2Tx also manifested remarkable stability by maintaining >95% initial activity after 10 successive reaction rounds. Further mechanistic studies indicated that the OVs of Au/Ti3C2Tx served as the active centers to efficiently adsorb and activate O2. More importantly, the doped Au atoms of Au/Ti3C2Tx were conducive to the recovery of OVs during photocatalytic process from the results of theoretical and experimental aspects.

On the basis of the novel electrocatalytic activity, Ti3C2Tx MXene was combined with alkaline phosphatase to construct a novel cascading catalytic amplification strategy using 1-naphthyl phosphate (1-NPP) as substrate, thereby realizing efficient electrochemical signal amplification. Taking advantage of the novel cascading catalytic amplification strategy, an electrochemical biosensor was fabricated for BCR/ABL fusion gene detection, which achieved excellent sensitivity with linear range from 0.2 fM to 20 nM and limit of detection down to 0.05 fM. This biosensor provided a promising tool for ultrasensitive fusion gene detection in early diagnosis of chronic myelogenous leukemia and acute lymphocytic leukemia.

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\n\\nThe complexity of the ionic and electronic dynamics in MXene based hybrids, which are normally involved for device integration, triggers both challenges and opportunities for its application. Herein, as a prototype of metallic hybrids of MXene, heterostructures consisting of Ti3C2T2 (T = None, O and F atoms) and metallic MoS2 (1T phase) are investigated for lithium-ion battery (LIB) applications. It is found that different surface atomic groups in MXene significantly alter the affinity, redox reaction and kinetics of Li atoms in the interface of the Ti3C2T2 and 1T-MoS2. Through examining the three possible pathways of Li by first-principles calculations and ab-initio molecular dynamics, the diffusion curve becomes significantly flattened from the naked to O- and F-terminated Ti3C2 MXene with activation barriers reducing dramatically from 0.80 to 0.22 and 0.29 eV, respectively, and accordingly promoted diffusion coefficients. The functionalization with O or F eliminates the steric hindrance of Li intercalation by breaking the strong interaction between two layers and provides additional adsorption sites for Li diffusion in the meantime. The work suggests that surface functional groups play a significant role in Ti3C2T2/1T-MoS2 modification and similar strategy via chemical modification of metallic hybrids provides hints for designing high performance anode material for LIBs.',\n",

Their surface chemistry is critical in many applications. This article reports amine functionalization of Ti3C2Tx MXene surface with [3-(2-aminoethylamino)-propyl]trimethoxysilane (AEAPTMS). Characterization techniques such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy verify the success of the surface functionalization and confirm that the silane coupling agent bonds to Ti3C2Tx surface both physically and chemically. The functionalization changes the MXene surface charge from −35 to +25 mV at neutral pH, which allows for in situ preparation of self-assembled films. Further, surface charge measurements of the functionalized MXene at different pH values show that the functionalized MXene has an isoelectric point at a pH around 10.7, and the highest reported positive surface charge of +62 mV at a pH of 2.58. Furthermore, the existence of a mixture of different orientations of AEAPTMS and the simultaneous presence of protonated and free amine groups on the surface of Ti3C2Tx are demonstrated. The availability of free amine groups on the surface potentially permits the fabrication of crosslinked electrically conductive MXene/epoxy composites, dye adsorbents, high-performance membranes, and drug carriers. Surface modifications of this type are applicable to many other MXenes.',\n",

Specifically, we synthesized Ti3C2-based MXene nanosheets and added them as a second filler to an Ag dispersion to fabricate Ag–MXene composite paste. Although the synthesized MXene nanosheets are somewhat less electrically conductive than pure Ag nanoparticles, the conductivity of the pattern formed by printing this composite paste was comparable to that of pure Ag nanoparticle-based electrode. Moreover, resistance in the resulting electrode remained fairly constant despite repeated bending employing a curvature radius of 2\\xa0mm. We attribute this to the presence of the MXene nanosheets, whose homogeneously distributed hydroxyl or oxygen terminate surface functional groups prevented or delayed the propagation of cracks inside the printed pattern despite repeated bending.\\nGraphic Abstract',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\n\\nMXenes with metallic conductivity, high pseudo-capacitance and 2D structure, are promising flexible electrode materials for supercapacitors, but suffer from the restacking issue, which hinders ion accessibility and causes sluggish ion kinetics. Herein, a simple in situ ice template strategy is proposed to fabricate free-standing, flexible 3D porous Ti3C2Tx/carbon nanotubes (CNTs) film (3D-PMCF) by freeze-drying Ti3C2Tx-based hydro-films without any postprocessing. During the freeze-drying process, small ice grains are in situ transformed from the residual water molecules in the Ti3C2Tx interlayer and then act as a self-sacrifice template to construct a 3D porous network. CNTs introduced in the hydro-film increase the amount of interlayer water and the resultant porosity. The 3D structure of Ti3C2Tx significantly increases the exposed surface active sites and accelerates the ion transport, meanwhile maintaining good flexibility. Consequently, the flexible 3D-PMCF film delivers a capacitance of 375 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1 and retains 251.2 F g−1 at 1000 mV s−1 with excellent cycling stability, much superior to the conventional densely stacked Ti3C2Tx film. Being assembled into a symmetric supercapacitor, an energy density of 9.2 Wh kg−1 is realized. This work demonstrates a simple and efficient route for constructing high-performance and flexible 3D MXene film electrodes for supercapacitors.',\n",

Since a noble metal-based structure is still the most satisfactory but scarce kind of catalyst, it is significant to allow for practical application of such catalysts by engineering the heterogeneous structure and developing green and facile synthetic strategies. Herein, we report a mechanochemical ball milling synthesis of platinum nanoclusters immobilized on a 2D transition metal carbide MXene (Nb2CTx) as an enhanced catalyst for hydrogen evolution. After annealing at 600 °C, ultrafine Pt3Nb nanoclusters are formed on the Pt/Nb2CTx catalyst. As prepared, the Pt/Nb2CTx-600 catalyst demonstrates superior electrochemical HER activity and stability with an ultralow overpotential of 5 mV and 46 mV to achieve 10 mA cm−2 and 100 mA cm−2, respectively, in comparison with other Nb2CTx-based catalysts and commercial Pt/C catalysts. Moreover, the remarkable durability is also confirmed by accelerated durability tests (ADTs) and long-term chronoamperometry (CA) tests. The excellent HER performance was attributed to high Pt dispersion and more active site exposure by the mechanochemical process and thermal treatment. Such results suggest that the mechanochemical strategy provides a novel approach for rational design and cost-effective production of electrocatalysts, also providing other potential applications in a wide range of areas.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'MXene, an emerging 2D material, has aroused great concern in the field of supercapacitors owing to its charming properties. However, the relatively low specific capacitance of pristine MXene is unsatisfactory, which is caused by the restacking issue of MXene nanosheets. In this paper, a facile and cost-effective electrostatic self-assembly followed by hydrothermal method was adopted to prepare NiCo2S4 decorated multilayer MXene nanosheets (MXene/NiCo2S4). The introduced NiCo2S4 effectively alleviates the self-restacking of MXene nanosheet and facilitates ion accessibility. Hence, the as-prepared MXene/NiCo2S4 electrode displays a maximum specific capacitance of 1211.1 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, surpassing the NiCo2S4 electrode (938.4 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) and pure MXene electrode (84.2 F g−1 at 1 A g−1). The assembled asymmetrical supercapacitor utilizing hybrid MXene/NiCo2S4 and RGO delivers a high energy density of 38.7 Wh kg−1 and high power density of 6137\\xa0W\\xa0kg−1. This work can provide a reliable reference for the synthesis of hybrid MXene/sulfide electrodes with ideal electrochemical performance.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'A superhydrophobic macroporous material composed of hollow hemispherical MXene (HSMX) was synthesized by the thermal annealing of MXene-wrapped cationic polystyrene spheres (CPS@MXene). Notably, the spherical MXene shells exhibited highly efficient catalysis of the carbonization of CPS into carbon nanoparticles. Their insertion into the interlayer of MXene increased the d-spacing and created hollow hemispheres. The as-prepared HSMX with nanoscale walls had a lower packing density than MXene, but higher porosity, total pore volume, and total pore area. Moreover, the stacking of hollow hemispheres promoted the formation of a highly undulating macroporous surface and significantly improved the surface roughness of the HSMX-based 3D membrane, resulting in superhydrophobicity with a water contact angle of 156.4° and a rolling angle of 6°. As a result, the membrane exhibited good separation efficiency and Flux for emulsifier-stabilized water-in-paraffin liquid emulsions, which was dependent on its superhydrophobic performance and strong demulsification ability derived from the razor effect originating from the ultrathin walls of HSMX. This work provides a facile approach for the transformation of highly hydrophilic 2D MXene into superhydrophobic 3D HSMX, and opens a new pathway for the development of advanced MXene-based materials for environmental remediation applications.',\n",

In this work, 2D Nb2CTx MXene nanosheets are prepared and their work function (WF) is reduced from 4.65 to 4.32\\xa0eV to match the conduction band minimum of perovskite layer by replacing the surface -F groups with \\uf8ffNH2 groups through hydrazine (N2H4) treatment. Besides, the N2H4 treated (T-Nb2CTx) MXene nanosheets with abundant \\uf8ffNH2 groups are incorporated into the perovskite precursor to retard the crystallization rate by forming hydrogen bond with iodine ions, which promotes the formation of high-quality and oriented growth perovskite films. Consequently, the PVSCs with T-Nb2CTx MXene ETLs and T-Nb2CTx MXene nanosheets additive exhibit the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.79% and the corresponding flexible and large-area devices achieve the highest PCE of 19.15% and 18.31%.

A novel developing trend focuses on a pressure sensor with high sensitivity over a wide pressure range, multifunction, breathability, and excellent wearing comfort, which remains a challenge. To address these issues, an all-fabric device is designed by loading Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets onto woven fabrics through a simple dip-coating method and sewing three fabric layers with different coating concentrations. The large resistance difference between the high-resistance middle layer and the low-resistance outer layer dominates the pressure sensing performance, whereas the two outer layers act as an extraction electrode and flexible Joule heater. The change in internal contact resistance of the trilayer fabric under pressure produces an ultrasensitive (2882–36328 kPa−1) pressure sensor over a wide pressure range (0–140\\xa0kPa), whereas sensitivity and detection limit can be regulated by controlling the coating concentration of the middle layer. In addition, the all-fabric structure endows the sensor with excellent wearing comfort. Multilevel and multiscale applications such as pulse contour, high load motion, tactile interface array, and large-area wearable heater demonstrate the broad application prospects in wearable healthcare electronics of the trilayer fabric.',\n",

In MXenes, a large class of recently developed 2D carbides and nitrides, low intercalation energy, high storage capacitance, and reversible intercalation of various cations have led to their improved performance in sensing and energy storage applications. Herein, a coupled nanopore-actuator system where an ultrathin free-standing MXene film serves as a nanopore support membrane and ionically active actuator is reported. In this system, the contactless MXene membrane in the electric field affects the cation movement in the field through their (de)intercalation between individual MXene flakes. This results in reversible swelling and contraction of the membrane monitored by ionic conductance through the nanopore. This unique nanopore coupled to a mechanical actuation system could provide new insights into designing single-molecule biosensing platforms at the nanoscale.',\n",

In comparison to the three-dimensional counterpart, the realization on two-dimensional ferrimagnetic half-metal remains blank up to date.

Such ferrimagnetic half-metallicity is also robust against external strains.

However, electrochemical capacitances exceeding the current state-of-the-art are required for enhanced transduction and stimulation of biological signals. The long-term stability of conducting polymer films during device operation and storage in aqueous environments remains a challenge for routine applications. In this work, we electrochemically synthesize a PEDOT composite comprising the water dispersible two-dimensional conducting material Ti3C2 MXene. We find that incorporating MXene as a co-dopant along with PSS leads to PEDOT:PSS:MXene films with remarkably high volumetric capacitance (607.0 ± 85.3 F cm−3) and stability (capacity retention = 78.44% ± 1.75% over 500 cycles), outperforming single dopant-comprising PEDOT films, i.e., PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:MXene electropolymerized under the same conditions on identical surfaces. The stability of microfabricated PEDOT:PSS:MXene electrodes is evaluated under different conditions, i.e., when the films are exposed to sonication (∼100% retention over 6 min), upon immersion in cell culture media for 14 days (∆|Z| = 2.13%), as well as after continuous electrical stimulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of a PEDOT:PSS:MXene electrode as an electrochemical sensor for sensitive detection of dopamine (DA). The sensor exhibited an enhanced electrocatalytic activity toward DA in a linear range from 1 µM to 100 μM validated in mixtures containing common interferents such as ascorbic acid and uric acid. PEDOT:PSS:MXene composite is easily formed on conductive substrates with various geometries and can serve as a high performance conducting interface for chronic biochemical sensing or stimulation applications.',\n",

The Ti2CO2 monolayer is found to be a semiconductor with a bandgap of 0.35\\u2009eV. The introduction of oxygen vacancies tends to increase the bandgap and leads to electronic phase transitions from nonmagnetic semiconductors to half-metals. Moreover, the semiconducting characteristic of O-vacancy Ti2CO2 can be adjusted via electric fields, strain, and F-atom substitution. In particular, an electric field can be used to alter the nonmagnetic semiconductor of O-vacancy Ti2CO2 into a magnetic one or into a half-metal, whereas the electronic phase transition from a semiconductor to metal can be achieved by applying strain and F-atom substitution. The results provide a useful guide for practical applications of O-vacancy Ti2CO2 monolayers in nanoelectronic and spinstronic nanodevices.',\n",

As a novel two-dimensional layered material, MXene possesses distinct structural, electronic, and chemical properties; thus, it has potential applications in many fields, including battery electrodes, energy storage materials, sensors, and catalysts. Up to now, more than 70 MAX phases have been reported. However, in contrast to the variety of MAX phases, the existing MXene family merely includes Ti2C, Ti3C2, (Ti1/2, Nb1/2)2C, (V1/2, Cr1/2)3C2, Nb2C, Ti3CN, Ta4C3, V2C, and Nb4C3. Among these materials, the Ti3C2Tx MXene exhibits prominently high volumetric capacitance, and the rate at which it transports electron is suitable for electrode materials in batteries and supercapacitors. Hence, Ti3C2Tx is commonly utilized as an electrode material in ion batteries such as Li+, Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, and Al3+ batteries. What is more, Ti2C has the biggest specific surface area among all of these potential MXene phases, and therefore, Ti2C has remarkably high gravimetric hydrogen storage capacities. In addition, Ti2CO2 materials display extremely high activity for CO oxidation, which makes it possible to design catalysts for CO oxidation at low temperatures. Furthermore, Ti3C2Tx with O, OH, and/or F terminations can be used for water purification owing to excellent water permeance, favorable filtration ability, and long-time operation ability. This review supplies a relatively comprehensive summary of various applications of MXenes over the past few years.',\n",

Here, a new type of perpendicular MXene–Li array is developed with tunable MXene walls and constant space in between as anodes for lithium metal batteries. Such perpendicular MXene arrays possess dual periodic interspaces, i.e., nanometer-scale interspaces in MXene walls and micrometer-scale interspaces between MXene walls. The former interspaces are favorable for the fast transfer of lithium ions upon stripping and plating, and the latter enables efficiently homogenization of the electric field, leading to a good high-rate capability up to 20 mA cm−2. More importantly, the notorious lightning rod effect and volume change are efficiently inhibited in such perpendicular MXene arrays, giving rise to a dendrite-free lithium anode with a low potential of 25 mV, a high capacity of 2056 mAh g−1, and good cycle stability up to 1700 h.',\n",

Heart-type fatty acid–binding protein (h-FABP) is an important biomarker in the diagnosis of AMI. In this work, an electrochemical h-FABP immunosensor was developed based on Cd0.5Zn0.5S/d-Ti3C2Tx MXene (MXene: Transition metal carbide or nitride) composite as signal amplificator and core-shell high-crystalline graphitic carbon nitride@carbon dots (hc-g-C3N4@CDs) as electrochemical sensor platform. Firstly, a facile calcination technique was applied to the preparation of hc-g-C3N4@CDs and immobilization of primary antibody was performed on hc-g-C3N4@CDs surface. Then, the conjugation of the second antibody to Cd0.5Zn0.5S/d-Ti3C2Tx MXene was carried out by strong π-π and electrostatic interactions. The prepared electrochemical h-FABP immunosensor was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), x-ray diffraction (XRD) method, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The prepared electrochemical h-FABP immunosensor indicated a good sensitivity with detection limit (LOD) of 3.30\\xa0fg\\xa0mL−1 in the potential range +0.1 to +0.5\\xa0V. Lastly, low-cost, satisfactory stable, and environmentally friendly immunosensor was presented for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction.Graphical abstract',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\nSteering the kinetics of photoexcited electron-hole pairs to achieve the elongated lifetime of carrier is one of key strategies to enhance the photocatalytic performance. Here, -OH terminated MXene and N-doped carbon dots (NCDs) are exploited as a hole mediator and electron acceptor, respectively, to enhance the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 nanosheets by optimizing the charge kinetics. The photogenerated hole and electron of TiO2 transferred to Ti3C2Tx and NCDs in the ternary NCDs/TiO2@Ti3C2Tx photocatalyst, respectively, resulting in effective separation of the photoinduced carriers. The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution and tetracycline hydrochloride (TC) degradation of NCDs/TiO2@Ti3C2Tx are ~ 4 and 9 times higher than those of TiO2, respectively. The DFT calculation shows that the Ti3C2Tx MXene with -OH termination has a low work function (Φ = 1.887 eV). The results of charge transfer dynamics and DFT calculation reveal that the photocatalytic enhancement of NCDs/TiO2@Ti3C2Tx is dominantly attributed to the synergistic effects of optimized charge kinetics, minimized interfacial defects, improved conductivity of Ti3C2Tx MXene, and strengthened up-conversion PL capability of NCDs. Our finding demonstrates that steering the interfacial charge kinetics is an effective way to improve the photocatalytic performance, which may be generally applicable in the photocatalysis.',\n",

Separator modification has been extensively investigated as an effective strategy to address above issues. Nevertheless, in the case of functional separators, how to effectively block the LiPSs from diffusion while enabling the rapid Li ion transport remains a challenge. Herein, by using an “oxidation-etching” method, MXene membranes are presented with controllable in-plane pores as interlayer to regulate Li ion transportation and LiPS immobilization. Porous MXene membranes with optimized pore density and size can simultaneously anchor LiPS and ensure fast Li ion diffusion. Consequently, even with pure sulfur cathode, the improved Li–S batteries deliver excellent rate performance up to 2 C with a reversible capacity of 677.6\\xa0mAh\\xa0g−1 and long-term cyclability over 500 cycles at 1 C with a low capacity decay of 0.07% per cycle.

Here, we investigated the electrochemical behavior of Ti3C2 MXene in 1M solution of 1-ethly-3-methylimidazolium bis- (trifluoromethylsulfonyl)-imide (EMITFSI) in acetonitrile and two other common organic electrolytes. This paper describes the use of clay, delaminated and composite Ti3C2 electrodes with carbon nanotubes in order to understand the effect of the electrode architecture and composition on the electrochemical performance. Capacitance values of 85\\xa0F\\xa0g−1 and 245\\xa0F\\xa0cm−3 were obtained at 2\\xa0mV\\xa0s−1, with a high rate capability and good cyclability. In situ X-ray diffraction study reveals the intercalation of large EMI+ cations into MXene, which leads to increased capacitance, but may also be the rate limiting factor that determines the device performance.Graphical abstractDownload : Download high-res image (372KB)Download : Download full-size image',\n",

Knowing the tendency of MXenes to oxidation and degradation, particularly at higher temperatures, structural modifications were proposed. They consisted of creating the metallic layer on the Ti3C2, by sputtering the titanium or molybdenum. To prepare the composites, powder metallurgy and spark plasma sintering (SPS) techniques were adopted. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the applied modifications, the emphasis of the research was placed on microstructural analysis. In addition, the mechanical properties of the obtained sinters were examined. Observations revealed significant changes in the MXenes degradation process, from porous areas with TiC particles (for unmodified Ti3C2), to in situ creation of graphitic carbon (in the case of Ti3C2-Ti/Mo). Moreover, the fracture changed from purely intergranular to cracking with high participation of transgranular mode, analogously. In addition, the results obtained showed an improvement in the mechanical properties for composites with Ti/Mo modifications (an increase of 10% and 15% in hardness and fracture toughness respectively, for specimens with 0.5 wt.% Ti3C2-Mo). For unmodified Ti3C2, enormously cracked areas with spatters emerged during tests, making the measurements impossible to perform.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\n\\nThe chemical stability of 2D MXene nanosheets in aqueous dispersions must be maintained to foster their widespread application. MXene nanosheets react with water, which results in the degradation of their 2D structure into oxides and carbon residues. The latter detrimentally restricts the shelf life of MXene dispersions and devices. However, the mechanism of MXene degradation in aqueous environment has yet to be fully understood. In this work, the oxidation kinetics is investigated of Ti3C2Tx and Ti2CTx in aqueous media as a function of initial pH values, ionic strengths, and nanosheet concentrations. The pH value of the dispersion is found to change with time as a result of MXene oxidation. Specifically, MXene oxidation is accelerated in basic media by their reaction with hydroxyl anions. It is also demonstrated that oxidation kinetics are strongly dependent on nanosheet dispersion concentration, in which oxidation is accelerated for lower MXene concentrations. Ionic strength does not strongly affect MXene oxidation. The authors also report that citric acid acts as an effective antioxidant and mitigates the oxidation of both Ti3C2Tx and Ti2CTx MXenes. Reactive molecular dynamic simulations suggest that citric acid associates with the nanosheet edge to hinder the initiation of oxidation.',\n",

However, the application of graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) nanofluids is extensively limited by its insufficient dispersibility and stability in the base fluid of water. Therefore, surface modification and post-functionalization of GNPs should be considered as further treatments to enhance their nanofluid properties, which is not economical for large-scale production. In the current study, we presented the processing, thermophysical, electrical and optical properties of a new generation of carbon-based nanofluid containing highly exfoliated autofluorescent hydrophilic 2D titanium carbide MXene (Ti3C2Tx) nanosheets. For the first time, the microstructure and nanofluid properties of the water-based Ti3C2Tx at two concentrations of 0.1 and 0.2\\xa0mass% have been further compared with covalently and non-covalently functionalized GNPs. Our results showed that the thermal/electrical conductivities of 0.1 and 0.2% MXene are remarkably higher (0.732 and 0.828\\xa0W\\xa0m─1\\xa0K─1, 1213 and 2690\\xa0µS\\xa0cm─1, respectively) compared with non-covalent GNPs at same concentrations (0.679 and 0.702\\xa0W\\xa0m─1\\xa0K─1, 723 and 1425\\xa0µS\\xa0cm─1, respectively) and competitive with COOH- and NH2-mediated GNPs samples. Additionally, the prominent stability and autofluorescence properties of MXene composite are other advantages supporting its nanofluid applications. The fluorescent MXene nanofluid at the different excitation/emission wavelengths (377–586\\xa0nm/447–647\\xa0nm) conferred a suitable optical contrast for visualization. Taken together, Ti3C2Tx material might open up a robust gateway for the application of carbon-based nanofluids in advanced heat transfer systems.',\n",

Due to their high charge storage capacity, metal-like conductivity, biocompatibility as well as hydrophilicity, Ti3C2Tx MXene-based inks hold great potential for scalable production of skin conformable electronics via direct printing methods. Herein, we develop an aqueous MXene ink and inkjet-print MXene films on freestanding, flexible, and conducting polymer-based substrates. These skin-adherent MXene electrodes detect electrocardiography signals with high signal-to-noise ratio while exhibiting preserved electrical performance after 1000 cycles of bending with a 50 d long shelf life in ambient conditions. We show that printed MXene films can be further functionalized to perform as multifunctional biosensing units. When integrated with a sodium (Na+) ion selective membrane, MXene electrodes detect Na+ in artificial sweat with a sensitivity of 40 mV per decade. When the films are functionalized with antibodies, they generate an electrical signal in response to a pro-inflammatory cytokine protein (interferon gamma) with a sensitivity of 3.9 mV per decade. Our findings demonstrate how inkjet-printed MXene films simplify the fabrication of next-generation wearable electronic platforms that comprise multimodal sensors.',\n",

Survey scanning obtained on the sample surface showed that the sample mainly contains C, O, Ti and F elements, and a little Al element. Analyzing the angle-resolved narrow scanning of these elements indicated that a layer of C and O atoms was adsorbed on the top surface of the sample, and there were many O or F related Ti bonds except Ti–C bond. XPS results obtained after argon ion etching indicated staggered distribution between C–Ti–C bond and O–Ti–C, F–Ti bond. It is confirmed that Ti atoms and C atoms were at the center layer of Ti3C2Tx MXene, while O atoms and F atoms were located at both the upper and lower surface of Ti3C2 layer acting as surface functional groups. The surface functional groups on the Ti3C2 layer were determined to include O2−, OH−, F− and O−–F−, among which F atoms could also desorb from Ti3C2Tx MXene easily. The schematic atomic structure of Ti3C2Tx MXene was derived from the analysis of XPS results, being consistent with theoretical chemical structure and other experimental reports.

The presence of molecular hydrogen at ambient conditions in a MXene ($\\\\mathrm{T}{\\\\mathrm{i}}_{3}{\\\\mathrm{C}}_{2}{T}_{x}$, where ${T}_{x}$ represents a surface terminating species, including O, OH, and F) material is revealed here by inelastic and elastic neutron scatterings. The inelastic neutron-scattering spectrum measured at 5 K shows a peak at 14.6 meV, presenting a clear indication of the presence of parahydrogen in the MXene synthesized using $48%$ hydrofluoric acid and annealed at $110{\\\\phantom{\\\\rule{0.16em}{0ex}}}^{\\\\ensuremath{\\\\circ}}\\\\mathrm{C}$ in vacuum prior to the measurement. An increase in the measurement temperature gradually reduces the peak intensity and increases the peak width due to the mobility of the molecular hydrogen in confinement. The presence of molecular hydrogen is confirmed further from the observed elastic intensity drop in a fixed energy-window scan of elastic intensity measurements in the temperature range of 10--35 K. Using milder etching conditions, ion intercalation, or an increase in the annealing temperature all result in the absence of the trapped hydrogen molecules in MXene. The results of this paper can guide the development of MXene materials with desired properties and improve our understanding of the behavior of MXenes in applications ranging from supercapacitors to hydrogen evolution reaction catalysis and hydrogen storage.',\n",

Methods: Prepared membranes were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM), profilometry, the contact angle measurements of various liquids in air, and the underwater contact angle of vegetable oil. The separation efficiency was evaluated by measuring the UV transmittance of stock solutions compared to the UV transmittance of the filtrate. Results: The MXene coating onto coPA mats led to changes in the permeability, hydrophilicity, and roughness of the membranes and enhanced the separation efficiency of the water/vegetable oil emulsions containing 10, 100, and 1000 ppm of sunflower vegetable oil. It was found that membranes were highly oleophobic (>124°) under water, unlike in air, where the membranes showed high oleophobicity (<5°). The separation efficiency of water/oil emulsions for both types of covered membranes reached over 99%, with a surface coverage of 3.2 mg/cm2 Ti3C2Tx (for ML-Ti3C2Tx) and 2.9 mg/cm2 (for SL-Ti3C2Tx). Conclusions: The separation efficiency was greater than 98% for membranes covered with 2.65 mg/cm2 of ML-Ti3C2Tx, whereas the separation efficiency for membranes containing 1.89 and 0.77 mg/cm2 was less than 90% for all studied emulsion concentrations.',\n",

However, molten-salt etching generally results in MXene clays that are not fully exfoliated or water-dispersible, thus preventing nanosheet processing. This occurs because molten-salt etching generally results in a high level of -F terminal functionalities that render the MXene clay hydrophobic. Here, we demonstrate a molten salt (SnF2) etching method that, for the first time, produces water-dispersible Ti3C2Tz nanosheets without the need for HF. In molten salt etching, SnF2 diffuses between the layers during etching to form AlF3 and Sn as byproducts; Sn spheres form internally and separate the layers. The stable, aqueous Ti3C2Tz dispersion yields a ζ potential of -31.7 mV, because of -OH terminal groups introduced by KOH washing. X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy confirm the formation of Ti3C2Tz etched clay with substantial d-spacing as compared to the clay from a traditional HF-process. This work is the first to use molten salt etching to successfully prepare colloidally stable aqueous dispersions of Ti3C2Tz nanosheets. The Ti3C2Tz nanosheet film and clay produced by this method also show excellent specific and areal capacitance and conductivity.',\n",

Metal ions play many crucial roles, such as in MXene delamination, structure regulation, surface modification, MXene composite construction, and even some unique applications. The different roles of metal ions are attributed to their many interactions with MXenes and the unique nature of MXenes, including their layered structure, surface chemistry, and the existence of multi-valent transition metals. Interactions with metal ions are crucial for the energy storage of MXene electrodes, especially in metal ion batteries and supercapacitors with neutral electrolytes. This review aims to provide a good understanding of the interactions between metal ions and MXenes, including the classification and fundamental chemistry of their interactions, in order to achieve their more effective utilization and rational design. It also provides new perspectives on MXene evolution and exfoliation, which may suggest optimized synthesis strategies. In this respect, the different effects of metal ions on MXene synthesis and processing are clarified, and the corresponding mechanisms are elaborated. Research progress on the roles metal ions have in MXene applications is also introduced.',\n",

Recently, MXenes considered as new blood in the form of 2D transition metal carbides (TMC), transition metal nitride or transition metal carbonitrides that are added first time to 2D nanomaterials family MXene which are compounds obtained as a result of chemical delamination of quaternary or (ternary) layered nitrides or carbides found as an outstanding member of 2D elemental materials. On behalf of rich chemistries and unique morphologies, the MXenes derivatives delivered efficient sensors, energy storage, catalysis, and water purification. The superior volumetric surface area provides improved sensor response and greater optic, electrical, and magnetic characteristics, which are important advantages in biological and biomedical applications over macroscale materials. In this review article, different synthetics strategies of Mxene derivatives are organized and discuss their availability in terms of caste, yield, physical properties, and simplicity. To keep in mind, the facile synthetic approach and stable physical properties, the Ti3C2Tx Mxene is chosen as a model Mxene derivative, and its application in the field of environmental and biological sensors is discussed in detail.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\n\\nThe fabrication of fully printable, flexible micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) with high energy and power density remains a significant technological hurdle. To overcome this grand challenge, the 2D material MXene has garnered significant attention for its application, among others, as a printable electrode material for high performing electrochemical energy storage devices. Herein, a facile and in situ process is proposed to homogeneously anchor hydrous ruthenium oxide (RuO2) nanoparticles on Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets. The resulting RuO2@MXene nanosheets can associate with silver nanowires (AgNWs) to serve as a printable electrode with micrometer-scale resolution for high performing, fully printed MSCs. In this printed nanocomposite electrode, the RuO2 nanoparticles contribute high pseudocapacitance while preventing the MXene nanosheets from restacking, ensuring an effective ion highway for electrolyte ions. The AgNWs coordinate with the RuO2@MXene to guarantee the rheological property of the electrode ink, and provide a highly conductive network architecture for rapid charge transport. As a result, MSCs printed from the nanocomposite inks demonstrate volumetric capacitances of 864.2 F cm−3 at 1 mV s−1, long-term cycling performance (90% retention after 10 000 cycles), good rate capability (304.0 F cm−3 at 2000 mV s−1), outstanding flexibility, remarkable energy (13.5 mWh cm−3) and power density (48.5 W cm−3).',\n",

The intrinsic power of natural photosynthesis may be significantly replicated by constructing Z-scheme-based charge-transfer heterostructures. In this study, a two-dimensional Ti3C2 MXene distributed NiAl-LDH/g-C3N4 heterojunction for increased photocatalytic hydrogen production under visible light has been examined in terms of design and fabrication. A modified hydrothermal technique was used to create a composite of NiAl-LDH/Ti3C2/g-C3N4 and effect of variables including catalyst loading, sacrificial reagents, and irradiation period was revealed. The photocatalytic activity of NiAL-LDH/Ti3C2/g-C3N4 composite for H2 evolution reached to 720 µmol g-1, which is 2, 1.4, and 1.2 times greater than g-C3N4, NiAL-LDH/g-C3N4, and Ti3C2/g-C3N4 samples, respectively. The formation of Z-scheme charge transfer heterojunctions contributed to alter the electronic properties of NiAL-LDH/Ti3C2/g-C3N4 and facilitating separation and migration of photoinduced electron-hole pairs. The stable layered structure, switchable property of layered composites, and high interface surface area of the composite were discovered to play crucial roles in boosting the photocatalytic efficiency for H2 production.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'AbstractElectrochromic technology plays a significant role in energy conservation, while its performance is greatly limited by the transport behavior of ions and electrons. Hence, an electrochromic system with overall excellent performances still need to be explored. Initially motivated by the high ionic and electronic conductivity of transition metal carbide or nitride (MXene), we design a feasible procedure to synthesize the MXene/WO3−x composite electrochromic film. The consequently boosted electrochromic performances prove that the addition of MXene is an effective strategy for simultaneously enhancing electrons and ions transport behavior in electrochromic layer. The MXene/WO3−x electrochromic device exhibits enhanced transmittance modulation and coloration efficiency (60.4%, 69.1 cm2 C−1), higher diffusion coefficient of Li+ and excellent cycling stability (200 cycles) over the pure WO3−x device. Meanwhile, numerical stimulation theoretically explores the mechanism and kinetics of the lithium ion diffusion, and proves the spatial and time distributions of higher Li+ concentration in MXene/WO3−x composite electrochromic layer. Both experiments and theoretical data reveal that the addition of MXene is effective to promote the transport kinetics of ions and electrons simultaneously and thus realizing a high-performance electrochromic device. This work opens new avenues for electrochromic materials design and deepens the study of kinetics mechanism of ion diffusion in electrochromic devices.',\n",

However, current reports are mostly focused on artificial neurons using an electric-driving mono-mode, while a facile and efficient approach to integrate electrical and optical signals is still lacking. Herein, a multifunctional optoelectronic hybrid-integrated neuron based on Ag nanoparticles-decorated MXene is proposed to achieve optoelectronic spatiotemporal information integration with low operating voltage of 0.93 V and high on/off ratio of 103, which are superior to those of majority of artificial neurons. An integrated visual perception system is developed by integrating artificial synapses, artificial optoelectronic neuron and robotic hand to emulate human conditional response. By integrating the optical sensory signals and electrical training signals, the response time of the system is significantly reduced. Finally, benefiting from the ability of spatiotemporal information integration, a multi-task pattern recognition in the spiking neural network composed of artificial synapses and neurons is completed, which can simultaneously recognize the digit patterns and rotation angles. Hence, this work exhibits the superiority in sensory and recognition tasks, which can pave the way for future application in neuromorphic circuits.',\n",

Three possible sites are found in Ti3C2Tx (T = F, OH, and O) to accommodate the nitrogen dopants: lattice substitution (for carbon), function substitution (for –OH), and surface absorption (on –O). Moreover, electrochemical test results confirm that all the three kinds of nitrogen dopants are favorable for improving the specific capacitance of the Ti3C2 electrode, and the underlying factors are successfully distinguished. By revealing the nitrogen doping mechanisms in Ti3C2 MXene, this work provides theoretical guidelines for modulating the electrochemical properties of MXene materials for energy storage applications.',\n",

Here we show that a silica-supported Cu/Mo2CTx (MXene) catalyst achieves a higher intrinsic methanol formation rate per mass Cu than the reference Cu/SiO2 catalyst with a similar Cu loading. The Cu/Mo2CTx interface can be engineered due to the higher affinity of Cu for the partially reduced MXene surface (in preference to the SiO2 surface) and the mobility of Cu under H2 at 500\\u2009°C. With increasing reduction time, the Cu/Mo2CTx interface becomes more Lewis acidic due to the higher amount of Cu+ sites dispersed onto the reduced Mo2CTx and this correlates with an increased rate of CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. The critical role of the interface between Cu and Mo2CTx is further highlighted by density functional theory calculations that identify formate and methoxy species as stable reaction intermediates. \\n                \\n                  \\n                    \\n                  \\n                \\n               The valorization of CO2 via its hydrogenation to methanol is a highly sought-after reaction although only a handful of catalysts can efficiently promote this transformation.

       "  'abstract': \"Abstract\\n\\nMXenes, as a legendary family of 2D van der Waals nanosheets materials, are extensively studied due to their unique characteristics of broadband nonlinear optical response. In particular, MXenes have excellent nonlinear optical properties of very large nonlinear absorption coefficients and very large nonlinear refractive indexes, which have attracted people's great attentions to study the application of MXenes in photonics, electronics, and optoelectronics in recent years. However, the high-repetition-rate (HRR) ultrafast pulses are not explored based on these kinds of materials. MXene Ti3C2Tx saturable absorber (SA) based on micro-fiber is fabricated by optical deposition method. Here, MXene Ti3C2Tx SA is used to achieve 36th harmonic mode-locking with a repetition rate of 218.4\\xa0MHz, a central wavelength of 1566.9\\xa0nm, the pulse width of 850 fs, and the spectral width of 3.51\\xa0nm. The maximum average output power and pulse energy are 6.95\\xa0mW and 0.032 nJ, respectively. This research based on MXene Ti3C2Tx light modulator opens a bright avenue for advanced nonlinear photonics.\",\n",

Nevertheless, their further development is limited by the problems of the self-stacking and low conductivity. In this paper, the high stability NiAl-LDH (NA-LDH) is embedded on the excellent conductivity MXene (Ti3C2Tx) by electrostatic self-assembly process. When the mass ratio of MXene to NA-LDH is 3:7 (M3L7), the composite electrode shows a high specific capacity (1276.83F g-1) at 1 A g-1. Besides, M3L7 emerges a quite marvelous rate capability at 10A g-1. The capacitance retention rate reaches 83.9%, which is far greater of pristine NA-LDH material (27.7%). The wrinkled accordion-like MXene structure alleviated the aggregation of NA-LDH during charging-discharging processes and increase the electronic transmission of the interface. After 4000 cycle tests, M3L7 electrode represents outstanding capacitance retention of 81.16% at 6A g-1, which is superior to pure NA-LDH (58.1%). Furthermore, an aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device assembled with M3L7 (Anode) and activated carbon (Cathode) shows a high energy density of 37.86Wh kg-1 at 1056.55W kg-1 and displays outstanding cycle stability with 86% capacitance retention after 4000 cycles.

Well-separated peaks in cyclic voltammograms (CVs) are considered key indicators of diffusion-controlled electrochemical processes with distinct Faradic charge transfer. Herein, we report on an electrochemical system with separated CV peaks, accompanied by surface-controlled partial charge transfer, in 2D Ti3C2Tx MXene in water-in-salt electrolytes. The process involves the insertion/desertion of desolvation-free cations, leading to an abrupt change of the interlayer spacing between MXene sheets.

This comprehensive review focuses on the synthesis methodologies and properties of MXenes and MXene-based materials for PV systems. Titanium carbide MXene (Ti3C2Tx), a well-known member of the MXene family, has been studied in many PV applications.

Subsequently, the utilization of Ti3C2Tx as a transparent conductive electrode, and its influence on the stability of the PV cells, are discussed. This review also considers problems that emerged from previous studies, and provides guidelines for the further exploration of Ti3C2Tx and other members of the 2D MXene family in PV technology.

In this work, titanium-carbide MXene (Ti3C2Tx) is introduced as a back electrode in Sb2(S,Se)3 thin-film solar cells (FTO/CdS/Sb2(S,Se)3/MXene) for the first time, which displaces traditional carbon (C) and gold (Au) electrodes entirely. Impressively, thanks to its high conductivity, mild reflectivity, and flexible flake architecture, the MXene-based device performance outperforms typical C and Au electrodes by 153% and 77%, respectively. Specifically, the tunable work function of MXene and a beneficial Sb–O bond formed between Sb2(S,Se)3 and MXene efficiently suppress the recombination and enhance charge transport by enjoying the unique merit of the rich terminal groups of MXene. As a result, the best efficiency of 8.29% of MXene-based Sb2(S,Se)3 solar device is achieved, which represents the highest performance of noble metal and/or hole transport layer-free derived Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells to date. This result has revealed that MXene is a feasible material to substitute the back electrode in Sb-based solar cells to reach high efficiency, low cost, and high stability.',\n",

Therefore, the degradation of CAP before release by gentle and efficient electrochemical hydrodechlorination (EHDC) has attracted tremendous interest. Platinum group metals are irreplaceable in EHDC but suffer from high cost and scarcity, necessitating strategies of reducing the particle size to increase the atom utilization efficiency. Here, ultra-small platinum nanoparticles @ Ti3C2Tx MXene (Pt@MXene) electrocatalyst was constructed through a general and facile approach. Benefitting from the synergy of electron transfer and atomic H*, 1% Pt@MXene could almost completely reduce CAP within 90\\xa0min (98.7%), and retained impressive removal efficiency (86.5%) after 25 recycling tests. Remarkably, the rate constant (k) contributed by unit mass of metal (k/ratio) of 1% Pt@MXene is 75 times higher than that of Commercial Pt/C. Two plausible degradation pathways on 1% Pt@MXene are deduced from the analysis of intermediate products. Besides, 1% Pt@MXene can be extended to actually remove the high content of CAP in the urine of hospital patients. This work paves an avenue for rational design of noble metal electrocatalysts on MXene and their applications in hydrodechlorination.Graphical abstractDownload : Download high-res image (260KB)Download : Download full-size image',\n",

Such smart composites could find application in the online health monitoring of complex-shaped parts.

The chemically etched Ti3C2Tz MXene nanoparticles were dispersed in deionised water and 10 layers were sprayed at the junction of the composite to form a conductive coating. The MXene-coated composite T-profile specimens were subjected to tensile and fatigue loading to study the electromechanical response of the MXene coating to applied displacement. The results showed that the MXene coating was able to sense the sample deformation till ultimate failure of the composite. The MXene coating was also able to effectively sense the tensile–tensile fatigue loading, carried out at 2000 cycles and 4000 cycles for a 50 N–0.5 Hz and a 100 N–1 Hz load–frequency combination, respectively, while being sensitive to the overall deformation of the composite.

Exploring the knittable fiber-type electrode with high capacitance would promote the wide-scale application of such capacitors. Herein, a solution-processed methodology to fabricate all-solid-state, flexible, and fiber-based supercapacitors employing Ti3C2Tx MXene is proposed. Commercially available silver-plated nylon fibers are chosen as fibrous structural support for the first time. Through mildly baking the surfactant-free Ti3C2Tx flakes suspension loaded on the silver-plated nylon fibers, a uniform and adhesive film consisting of Ti3C2Tx nanometer-thick flakes is well established in a parallel manner on the highly conductive fibrous support. It is emphasized that the chemically cross-linked polyvinyl alcohol–H2SO4 hydrogel is served as a solid-state electrolyte that guarantees the structural integrity and mechanical strength of the assembled capacitor. The fabricated capacitor exhibits a high areal capacitance of 328 mF cm−2 with excellent cyclability and flexibility, capacitance retention remaining at least above 80% under various deformation modes including bending, twisting, and knotting. The device based on the all-solid-state, fiber-type capacitors can drive a light-emitting diode. This work proposes a feasible strategy, offering a platform for rational designs of flexible electronics employing a large family of MXenes and their heterostructures as well.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Herein, we report on a novel two-dimensional (2D) material application, which shows that an accordion-like layered Ti3C2 nanomaterial (MXene) with an excellent adsorption capacity of Cr(VI) from aqueous solution was prepared by etching Al layer from Ti3AlC2 phase in hydrofluoric acid (HF) solution. Ti3C2 nanopowders were well characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and the physical property of as-obtained samples was studied by UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS). After HF treatment, Ti3AlC2 not only has a phase transition from one crystal to another, but surprisingly, its microstructure is also undergoing an obvious change. Ti3C2 with product of change possesses an accordion-like multilayer structure, and a relatively higher specific surface area (SSA) than untreated Ti3AlC2. Then, accordion-like Ti3C2 with a high SSA provides abundant active sites for pollutant removal and functionalization. Accordion-like Ti3C2 nanomaterial exhibits a stable adsorption capacity, and 1[Formula: see text]g as-prepared accordion-like Ti3C2 powders can remove about 80[Formula: see text]mg potassium dichromate. Therefore, the results suggest that 2D MXenes are promising as an effective nanoadsorbent in heavy metal removal from the wastewater.',\n",

However, few researches have focused on the differences between the three additives. Herein, silicon, as a typical anode, is selected to integrate with MXene, GO and CNTs in carbon nanofibers (CNFs) and form Si/MXene@CNFs, Si/GO@CNFs and Si/CNTs@CNFs, respectively. Together with the results, it can be realized that these CNFs with a significant improved performance compared with pure Si@CNFs show superiority in different aspects of electrochemical properties. Additionally, the reasons for the superiority are also discussed in this work. The addition of MXene can improve the cycle stability of the electrodes, thereby obtaining a high capacity retention rate, CNTs are favorable for the enhancement of rate performance, and the electrodes reversible capacity can be increased due to the addition of GO. Consequently, the studies on three additives may contribute to the rational design of silicon-based and other anode materials.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Traditional ways of producing drinking water from groundwater, water recycling and water conservation are not sufficient. Seawater desalination would close the gap but the main technology used is thermally driven multi-flash distillation, which is energy consuming and not sustainable. Stacking two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials into lamellar membranes is a promising technique in the pursuit of both high selectivity and permeance in water desalination. However, 2D membranes tend to swell in water, and increasing their stability in aqueous solution is still challenging. Here, we report non-swelling, MXene membranes prepared by the intercalation of Al3+ ions. Swelling is prevented by strong interactions between Al3+ and oxygen functional groups terminating at the MXene surface. These membranes show excellent non-swelling stability in aqueous solutions up to 400\\u2009h and possess high rejection of NaCl (~89.5–99.6%) with fast water fluxes (~1.1–8.5\\u2009l\\u2009m−2\\u2009h−1). Such membranes can be easily fabricated by simple filtration and ion-intercalating methods, which holds promise for their scalability. Two-dimensional lamellar membranes for water purification are promising but suffer from swelling that reduces their ion sieving performance in water. This study reports easy-to-fabricate, non-swelling MXene membranes prepared by the intercalation of Al3+ ions that could be scalable.',\n",

To mitigate these problematic situations, many countries relied on non-conventional freshwater generation technologies through solar desalination of seawater. In this manner, we excel the ability of new class 2D Ti3C2 MXenes as a photothermal material (solar absorber) for freshwater generation via the solar desalination technique. In this review, the air–water interfacial interaction is highlighted for improving the evaporation efficiency. To provide the dependence of the desalination efficiency on the microstructure of the solar absorbers, we summarized various forms of 2D Ti3C2 MXenes (aerosol, films, foam, hydrogel, membrane, monolith and porous structure) and their characteristics. These microstructures prevailed ultrahigh photoconversion efficiency. In this aspect, we further explained key features such as light absorption, reflection, multiple internal reflection, hydrophilicity, lower thermal conduction, light-to-heat generation, and salt rejection for achieving efficient desalination output throughout the visible and broadband region. Specifically, we targeted to explore the self-floating and salt rejection nature of various state-of-the-art 2D Ti3C2 MXene structures. Further, we highlighted the long-term stability. Among the above morphologies, Ti3C2 MXene in the form of a membrane is believed to be a promising morphology which effectively desalinates seawater into freshwater.

Herein, a simple and general strategy for constructing a novel functional 3D MXene-based composite heterojunction aerogel (MS@S-MAs) is presented via divalent metal-ion assembly and subsequent thermal sulfidation, and its application in electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is studied. The as-prepared MS@S-MAs comprises metal sulfide nanoparticles uniformly confined in 3D interconnected conductive S-doped MXene sheets with intimate interfacial interaction. Benefiting from the unique properties and an interfacial interaction, MS@S-MAs exhibit significantly improved NRR catalytic performance and excellent stability because of the higher exposure of electrochemically active sites coupled with easier accessibility, faster mass diffusion, and quicker carrier transport at the interface. Remarkably, CoS@S-MAs show an NH3 yield rate and a Faradaic efficiency of 12.4 µg h−1 mg−1cat and 27.05% at the lower potential of −0.15\\xa0V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode in 0.1 m Na2SO4 solution under ambient conditions, which rivals or exceeds most of the previously reported MXene-based and Co-based catalysts.

Here, we employed a natural sedimentation method instead of the conventional vacuum-assisted filtration to prepare flexible Ti3C2Tx MXene films with enlarged interlayer spacing, which facilitates the access of the lithium ions to the interlayers and thus leads to a greatly enhanced electrochemical performance. The naturally sedimented flexible film shows a double lithium storage capacity compared to the conventional vacuum-filtered MXene film, along with improved rate performance and excellent cycle stability.',\n",

The results showed a significant increase of fracture toughness and hardness for composite, respectively 36% and 13%. The numerical study involving this novel method of modelling shows the presence of a complex state of stress in the material, which is related to the anisotropic properties of graphitic carbon structures formed during sintering.

Here, the aramid nanofiber/Ti3C2Tx MXene (ANF/MXene) composite films with multilayer structure were successfully prepared through a simple alternate vacuum-assisted filtration (AVAF) process. With the intervention of the ANF layer, the multilayer-structure film exhibits excellent mechanical properties. The ANF2/MXene1 composite film exhibits a tensile strength of 177.7 MPa and a breaking strain of 12.6%. In addition, the ANF5/MXene4 composite film with a thickness of only 30 μm exhibits an electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding efficiency of 37.5 dB and a high EMI-specific shielding effectiveness value accounting for thickness (SSE/t) of 4718 dB·cm2 g−1. Moreover, the composite film was excellent in heat-insulation performance and in avoiding light-to-heat conversion. No burning sensation was produced on the surface of the film with a thickness of only 100 μm at a high temperature of 130 °C. Furthermore, the surface of the film was only mild when touched under simulated sunlight.

However, substantial efforts have been devoted in maximizing the UV and/or visible light absorption efficiency, and suppressing the annihilation of photogenerated charged species in pristine mesoporous TiO2 structure for improved solar illumination conversion efficiencies. This study provides the fundamental insights into Mxene functionalized mesoporous TiO2 as photoelectrode for the first time. This novel combination of Mxene functionalized TiO2 electrodes with and without TiCl4 treatments have been successfully optimized to intensify the process of photon absorption, charge segregation and photocurrent, resulting in superior photoelectrode performance. The photocurrent measurements of prepared photoelectrodes are significantly enhanced upon increased contents of Mxene due to improved absorption efficiency within the visible region as verified by UV&ndash;Vis absorption spectroscopy. Moreover, as evident through structural analysis, the anatase phase of TiO2 is well grown due to increased contents of Mxene and post-deposition heat treatments. Consequently, an appreciable coverage of well-developed grains on FTO surface observed in SEM images.

       "  'abstract': 'From first principles electronic structure calculations, we unravel the evolution of structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of pristine, defected, and strained titanium nitride MXene with different functional groups (-F, -O, -H, and -OH). The formation and cohesive energies reveal their chemical stability. The MAX phase and defect free functionalized MXenes are metallic except for oxygen terminated (Ti 2 NO 2 ) one which is 100% spin polarized half-metallic ferromagnet. The spin-orbit coupling significantly influences the bare MXene (Ti 2 N) to exhibit Dirac topology and band inversion near the high symmetry directions and Fermi level. The strain effect sways the Fermi level thereby shifting it toward lower energy state under compression and toward higher energy state under tensile strain in Ti 2 NH 2 . The Ti 2 NO 2 exhibits exotic electronic structure and magnetic states not only in pristine but also in strained and defected structures. Its half-metallic nature changes to semi-metallic under 1% compression and it is completely destroyed under 2% compression. In single vacancy defect, its band structure remarkably transforms from half-metallic to semi-conducting with large band gap in 12.5% Ti, weakly semi-conducting in 5.5% Ti, and semi-metallic in 12.5% O. The 25% N defect changes it’s half-metallic characteristic to metallic. Further, the 12.5% Co substitution preserves it’s half-metallic character, whereas Mn substitution allows it to convert half-metallic characteristic into weak semi-metallic characteristic preserving ferromagnetism. However, Cr substitution converts half-metallic ferromagnetic state to half-metallic anti-ferromagnetic state. The understanding made here on collective structural stability, and electronic band structure, and magnetic phenomena in novel 2D Ti 2 N derived MXenes open up their possibility in designing them for synthesis and thereby taking to applications.',\n",

However, some supports are susceptible to being dissolved in acidic solution or are unstable in ambient air. The development of high-performance catalysts has been facing the major hurdles of the sluggish activity in alkaline solution and requesting high energy to stabilize the nanoparticles on their supports, challenging the pH-universality and the applicability of the supported metallic nanoparticles. Here, a one-step strategy is proposed to modulate the growth of Pt quantum dots (QDs) on HF-free MXene under atomic-level by a low-temperature metal–support interaction reaction. By controllable tailoring in the morphology and strain induced by terminations, Pt (111) QDs with a sub-nanoscale size of 1.15\\xa0nm are grown as 0D/1D heterostructure to overcome the restrictions of employing reduction gas and high annealing temperature. The catalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 33.3\\xa0mV for acidic solution, while 65.1\\xa0mV for alkaline solution at a specific current density of 10\\xa0mA cm−2. This study not only paves a scalable pathway to developing cost-efficient catalysts in moderate conditions, but also demonstrates an effective surface modulation strategy for 0D/1D heterostructures.',\n",

The MXene matrix not only possesses high elasticity to buffer the volume variation of SiO2 nanoparticles, but also promotes the transfer of electrons and lithium ions. Moreover, the microsphere wrapped with ductile MXene film reduces the specific surface area, relieves the side reactions, and enhances the coulombic efficiency.

       "  'abstract': 'AbstractThis article describes the manufacturing of silicon carbide composites with the addition of quasi-two-dimensional titanium carbide Ti3C2, known as MXene. The composites were obtained by the powder metallurgy technique, consolidated with the use of the Spark Plasma Sintering method at 1900 °C and dwelled for 30 min. The influence of the Ti3C2 MXene addition on the microstructure and mechanical properties of the composites was investigated. The structure of the MXene phase after the sintering process was also analyzed. The results showed a significant increase (almost 50%) of fracture toughness for composites with the addition of 0.2 wt% Ti3C2 MXene. In turn, the highest hardness, 23.2 GPa, was noted for the composite with the addition of the 1.5 wt% Ti3C2 MXene phase. This was an increase of over 10% in comparison to the reference sample. The analysis of chemical composition and observations using a transmission electron microscope showed that the Ti3C2 MXene phase oxidizes during sintering, resulting in the formation of crystalline, highly defected, disordered graphite structures. The presence of these structures in the microstructure, similarly to graphene, significantly affects the hardness and fracture toughness of silicon carbide.',\n",

Herein, a versatile strategy is proposed for the preparation of thermodynamically stable 1T-MoS2/MXene heterostructures with the aid of delaminated Ti3C2Tx MXene (d-Ti3C2Tx) dispersion containing tetrabutylammonium hydroxide. The 2D d-Ti3C2Tx provides more uniform nucleation sites for MoS2, and the TBA+ ions can intercalate into MoS2 to induce the phase conversion from semiconducting 2H to 1T. Moreover, the electrochemical advantages of 1T-MoS2 and d-Ti3C2Tx can be united by the construction of a well-organized heterostructure. Outstanding rate performance is realized because of extra-large interlayer space of 1T MoS2 with TBA+ intercalation and decreased energy barrier for fast Li+ diffusion. Subsequently, a lithium-ion capacitor (LIC) is assembled based on 1T-MoS2/d-Ti3C2Tx as anode and hierarchically porous graphene nanocomposite with micro/mesoporous structure as a cathode. The LIC exhibits a large energy density up to 188\\xa0Wh kg−1, an ultra-high power density of 13\\xa0kW kg−1, together with remarkable capacity retention of 83% after 5000 cycles. This study demonstrates the great promise of 1T-MoS2/d-Ti3C2Tx heterostructures as anode for high-performance LICs.',\n",

Consequently, the o-P-CoTe2/MXene superstructure exhibits boosted potassium-storage performance, in terms of high reversible capacity (373.7 mAh g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 after 200 cycles), remarkable rate capability (168.2 mAh g−1 at 20 A g−1), and outstanding long-term cyclability (0.011% capacity decay per cycle over 2000 cycles at 2 A g−1), representing the best performance in transition-metal-dichalcogenides-based anodes to date. Impressively, the flexible full battery with o-P-CoTe2/MXene anode achieves a satisfying energy density of 275\\xa0Wh kg−1 and high bending stability. The kinetics analysis and first-principles calculations reveal superior pseudocapacitive property, high electronic conductivity, and favorable K+ ion adsorption and diffusion capability, corroborating fast K+ ion storage.

However, transparent MXene electrodes suitable for polymer light-emitting diodes (PLEDs) have rarely been demonstrated. With the discovery of the excellent electrical stability of MXene under an alternating current (AC), herein, PLEDs that employ MXene electrodes and exhibit high performance under AC operation (AC MXene PLEDs) are presented. The PLED exhibits a turn-on voltage, current efficiency, and brightness of 2.1 V, 7 cd A−1, and 12 547 cd m−2, respectively, when operated under AC with a frequency of 1 kHz. The results indicate that the undesirable electric breakdown associated with heat arising from the poor interface of the MXene with a hole transport layer in the direct-current mode is efficiently suppressed by the transient injection of carriers accompanied by the alternating change of the electric polarity under the AC, giving rise to reliable light emission with a high efficiency. The solution-processable MXene electrode can be readily fabricated on a flexible polymer substrate, allowing for the development of a mechanically flexible AC MXene PLED with a higher performance than flexible PLEDs employing solution-processed nanomaterial-based electrodes such as carbon nanotubes, reduced graphene oxide, and Ag nanowires.',\n",

The response surface methodology was employed to investigate the interactive effects of adsorption parameters (adsorption time, pH of the solution, initial concentration, and the adsorbent dose) and optimize these parameters for obtaining maximum adsorption efficiency of EE2. The significance of independent variables and their interactions were tested by the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and t-test statistics. Optimization of the process variables for maximum adsorption of EE2 by Fe3O4@Ti3C2 was performed using the quadratic model. The model predicted maximum adsorption of 97.08% under the optimum conditions of the independent variables (adsorption time 6.7 h, pH of the solution 6.4, initial EE2 concentration 0.98 mg L−1, and the adsorbent dose 88.9 mg L−1) was very close to the experimental value (95.34%). pH showed the highest level of significance with the percent contribution (63.86%) as compared to other factors.

The goodness of fit of the model was checked by the coefficient of determination (R2) between the experimental and predicted values of the response variable. The response surface methodology successfully reflects the impact of various factors and optimized the process variables for EE2 adsorption. The kinetic adsorption data for EE2 fitted well with a pseudo-second-order model, while the equilibrium data followed Langmuir isotherms. Thermodynamic analysis indicated that the adsorption was a spontaneous and endothermic process. Therefore, Fe3O4@Ti3C2 composite present the outstanding capacity to be employed in the remediation of EE2 contaminated wastewaters.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\nHeteroatom doping has been proven to be an effective strategy to improve the electrochemical energy storage capacity of two-dimensional MXenes. However, the heteroatom for MXenes is focused on the N atoms, while the effects and underlying mechanisms of O substituted partial C atoms for MXene have not been explored so far. Herein, comprehensive research is firstly performed to reveal the oxygen doping mechanism in Ti3C2Tx MXene by the experimental characterization and the density functional theory simulation. The in situ oxygen doped Ti3C2Tx nanosheets, in which oxygen atoms substitute partial carbon atoms in the titanium octahedron, are synthesized by etching the oxygen doped Ti3AlC2 MAX phase, which is more facile than the complex post-doped process. The introduction of appropriate oxygen atoms can effectively improve the interlayer space, electronic conductivity, and interface charge transfer of the Ti3C2Tx MXene as a supercapacitor electrode. Further, the electrochemical performances demonstrate that the oxygen doped MXene (O-Ti3C2Tx-0.05) film electrode can deliver a higher capacity of 306.0 C g-1 compared to the pristine Ti3C2Tx electrode (216.8 C g-1). Besides, the quantitative analysis results imply that the enhanced capacitance is mainly attributed to the diffusion-controlled capacitance and interface capacitance, which result from the higher Ti metal active center, the enhanced quantum capacitance, and the higher adsorption energy.',\n",

However, MXene materials have low surface area utilization due to the agglomeration of ultrathin nanosheets. Assembling 2D MXene nanosheets into 3D multi-level architectures is an effective way to circumvent this issue. Incorporation of MXene with other nanomaterials during the assembly process could rationally tune and tailor the specific surface area, porosity and surface chemistry of the MXene assemblies. The complementary and synergistic effect between MXene and nanomaterials could expand their advantages and make up for their disadvantages, thus boost the performance of 3D porous MXene composites.

Here, a planar, dendrite-free Li metal growth on 2D Ti3C2Tx MXene is reported. Ab initio calculations suggest that Li forms a hexagonal close-packed (hcp) layer on the surface of Ti3C2Tx via ionic bonding and the lattice confinement. The ionic bonding weakens gradually after a few monolayers, resulting in a nanometers-thin transition region of hcp-Li. Above this transition region, the deposition is dominated by plating of body-centered cubic (bcc) Li via metallic bonding. Formation of a dense and planar Li metal anode with preferential growth along the (110) facet is explained by the lattice matching between Ti3C2Tx and hcp-Li and then with bcc-Li, as well as preferred thermodynamic factors including the large dendrite formation energy and small migration barrier for Li. The prepared Li metal anode shows stable cycling in a wide current density range from 0.5 to 10.0 mA cm–2. The LiFePO4‖Li full cell fabricated with this Li metal anode exhibits only 9.5% capacity fading after 500 charge–discharge cycles at 1 C rate.',\n",

Non-swelling hydrogels would be a preferable candidate for underwater sensing with stable sensing performance. Herein, hydrogels comprised of MXene and polyhydroxyethyl methacrylate (PHEMA) are designed and manufactured. Owing to the synergistic effect of phase separation zones and hydrophilic/hydrophobic interaction, MXene/PHEMA hydrogels exhibit non-swelling performance in various liquid media (e.g., water, seawater) and effectively avoid the adhesion of proteins and bacteria. In addition, MXene/PHEMA hydrogels exhibit a large sensing range (more than 400%), high tensile strength (0.54\\xa0MPa), and skin-compliance modulus (120\\xa0kPa). Furthermore, the resulted hydrogel-based sensors possess superior sensibility (4.42 at 150–450% strain), fast responsiveness (200\\xa0ms), and durable sensing ability (over 1000\\xa0cycles). The hydrogel-based sensors can accurately monitor human motions (both large and subtle motions) in air and in various liquid media. Benefiting from the non-swelling and anti-fouling ability, the hydrogels could maintain high mechanical strength and cyclic stability after being immersed in water for 30 days, and precisely detect the movement of human and shark models underwater. It is conceivable that non-swelling and anti-fouling MXene/PHEMA hydrogels provide a feasible material to construct electronic skins for various harsh liquid environments.',\n",

Platinum (Pt) is the most promising catalyst for electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) so far, but the high cost and agglomeration of Pt nanostructures brought it limitations. Herein, we report an electrocatalyst with surface-engineered Pt nanoclusters with relatively low content (0.96\\xa0wt%) supported on a two-dimensional (2D) MXene substrate (Ti2CTx, Tx represents surface functional groups) and Pt3Ti alloy interfaces formed after annealing at 900\\xa0°C. Pt/Ti2CTx-900 exhibits superior HER activity (achieving 10\\xa0mA\\xa0cm−2 at an overpotential of 1.7\\xa0mV) and excellent stability under continuous tests. Therefore, this easy-to-operate strategy develops a superior low-cost electrocatalyst for HER, paving the way for future development of other highly active and robust functional composite materials.Graphical abstractDownload : Download high-res image (101KB)Download : Download full-size image',\n",

The effects of intercalated metal ions on the vibrational states of water confined in ${\\\\mathrm{Ti}}_{3}{\\\\mathrm{C}}_{2}{T}_{x}$ MXenes have been explored using inelastic neutron scattering (INS) and molecular-dynamics simulations to better understand the mechanisms that control MXenes' behavior in aqueous electrolytes, water purification, and other important applications. We observe an INS signal from water in all samples, pristine and with lithium, sodium, or potassium ions intercalated between the 2D ${\\\\mathrm{Ti}}_{3}{\\\\mathrm{C}}_{2}{T}_{x}$ layers. However, only a small amount of water is found to reside in ${\\\\mathrm{Ti}}_{3}{\\\\mathrm{C}}_{2}{T}_{x}$ intercalated with metal ions. Water in pristine ${\\\\mathrm{Ti}}_{3}{\\\\mathrm{C}}_{2}{T}_{x}$ is more disordered, with bulklike characteristics, in contrast to intercalated ${\\\\mathrm{Ti}}_{3}{\\\\mathrm{C}}_{2}{T}_{x}$, where water is more ordered, irrespective of the metal ions used for intercalation. The ordering of the confined water increases with the ion size. This finding is further confirmed from molecular-dynamics simulation, which showed an increase in interference of water molecules with increasing ion size resulting in a concomitant decrease in water mobility, therefore providing guidance to tailor MXene properties for energy and environmental applications.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'AbstractRational construction of hybrid nanostructures is one of the efficient approaches to designing high-performance and flexible energy devices. However, the achievement of improved electrochemical energy storage performance and low-cost production are challenging aspects for scalable production. Herein, the solid-state flexible asymmetric supercapacitor devices are fabricated by employing MXene (Ti3C2Tx) as negative electrode and composites of spinel NiCo2S4 with nanocarbons (reduced graphene oxide (rGO), multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT)) and MXene (Ti3C2Tx) as positive electrode prepared by simple hydrothermal method. From the comparative studies, NCS@TCX (NiCo2S4@Ti3C2Tx) composite exhibited a high specific capacitance of 1076 F/g as well as a good capacity value of 591.45 C/g at the current density of 3A/g with 80% of capacitance retention over 5000 cycles. The capacity rate of the NCS@TCX electrode manifests the diffusion-controlled process revealed through detailed kinetic studies. Additionally, comparative supercapacitor performance of NCS and its composites in asymmetric assembly with MXene (Ti3C2Tx) is investigated. The flexible NCS@TCX//TCX solid-state asymmetric device showed excellent electrochemical energy storage performance as compared to other devices that deliver maximum areal energy density of 11.5 μWh/cm2 and power density of 1.24 mW/cm2 with the areal capacitance of 57.47 mF/cm2 without compromising on the rate capability (90% over 5000 cycles). Also, the devices demonstrated good mechanical and electrical stability after bending at various angles. Comparatively, the NCS@rGO@MWCNT//TCX device showed outstanding cycling performance (99% over 5000 cycles at 10\\xa0mA/cm2). Thus, NCS and its nanocarbon and MXene hybrids can be further exploited constructively for the fabrication of high-performance flexible energy storage device applications.Graphical abstract',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\n\\nSelenium (Se), due to its high electronic conductivity and high energy density, has recently attracted considerable interest as a cathode material for rechargeable Li/Na batteries. However, the poor cycling stability originating from the severe shuttle effect of polyselenides hinders their practical applications. Herein, highly stable Li/Na–Se batteries are developed using ultrathin (≈270 nm, loading of 0.09 mg cm−2) cetrimonium bromide (CTAB)/carbon nanotube (CNT)/Ti3C2Tx MXene hybrid modified polypropylene (PP) (CCNT/MXene/PP) separators. The hybrid separator can immobilize the polyselenides via enhanced Lewis acid–base interactions between CTAB/MXene and polyselenides, which is demonstrated by theoretical calculations and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The incorporation of CNT helps to improve the electrolyte infiltration and facilitate the ionic transport. In situ permeation experiments are conducted for the first time to visually study the behavior of polyselenides, revealing the prohibited shuttle effect and protected Li anode from corrosion with CCNT/MXene/PP separators. As a result, the Li–Se batteries with CCNT/MXene/PP separators deliver an outstanding cycling performance over 500 cycles at 1C with an extremely low capacity decay of 0.05% per cycle. Moreover, the hybrid separators also perform well in Na–Se batteries. This study develops a preferable separator–electrolyte interface and the concept can be applied in other conversion-type battery systems.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\n\\nFast ion adsorption processes in supercapacitors enable quick storage/delivery of significant amounts of energy, while ion intercalation in battery materials leads to even larger amounts of energy stored, but at substantially lower rates due to diffusional limitations. Intercalation of ions into the recently discovered 2D Ti3C2Tx (MXene) occurs with a very high rate and leads to high capacitance, posing a paradox. Herein, by characterizing the mechanical deformations of MXene electrode materials at various states-of-charge with a variety of cations (Li, Na, K, Cs, Mg, Ca, Ba, and three tetra\\xadalkylammonium cations) during cycling by electrochemical quartz-crystal admittance (EQCA, quartz-crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring) combined with in situ electronic conductance and electrochemical impedance, light is shone on this paradox. Based on this work, it appears that the capacitive paradox stems from cationic insertion, accompanied by significant deformation of the MXene particles, that occurs so rapidly so as to resemble 2D ion adsorption at solid-liquid interfaces. The latter is greatly facilitated by the presence of water molecules between the MXene sheets.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\n\\nSodium (Na) metal is a promising alternative to lithium metal as an anode material for the next-generation energy storage systems due to its high theoretical capacity, low cost, and natural abundance. However, dendritic/mossy Na growth caused by uncontrollable plating/stripping results in serious safe concerns and rapid electrode degradation. This study presents Sn2+ pillared Ti3C2 MXene serving as a stable matrix for high-performance dendrite-free Na metal anode. The intercalated Sn2+ between Ti3C2 layers not only induces Na to nucleate and grow within Ti3C2 interlayers, but also endows the Ti3C2 with larger interlayer space to accommodate the deposited Na by taking advantage of the “pillar effect,” contributing to uniform Na deposition. As a result, the pillar-structured MXene-based Na metal electrode could enable high current density (up to 10 mA cm−2) along with high areal capacity (up to 5 mAh cm−2) over long-term cycling (up to 500 cycles). The full cell using MXene-based Na metal anode exhibits superior electrochemical performance than that using host-less commercial Na. It is believed that the well-controlled MXene-based Na anode not only extends the application scope of MXene, but also provides guidance in designing high-performance Na metal batteries.',\n",

Here, we fabricated a smart wearable textile called the MXene-containing pressure sensor with both sensing and electrothermal properties, in which the MXene nanofiber film is used as the electric heating layer, and the spacer fabric coated with MXene is used as the pressure layer. After electrospinning, MXene was successfully adhered to the surface of the pressure layer by polyacrylonitrile as a nanofiber film, which shows excellent Joule heating properties. The novel structure enables high sensitivity (508.79\\u2009kPa−1, from 1 to 5\\u2009kPa; 29,397.97\\u2009kPa−1, from 12 to 35\\u2009kPa), good electric heating (over 70°C under 18\\u2009V), high breathability (mesh structure) and shock absorption because of the reticulated spacer fabric. There are many potential applications, such as smart insoles, cushions and mattresses, and in this work smart insoles were fabricated for monitoring human motions whether in walking or running. Another applied device is a numeric keyboard, which can recognize finger presses as different numbers. Overall, we provide a new strategy for the fabrication of a multifunctional MXene/spacer fabric-based pressure sensor, and may encourage the innovation of intelligent tactile textiles, which have potential applications in modern medicine and robot protection.',\n",

Two-dimensional MXenes are generally synthesized through the selective etching of the parent MAX phase using etchants based on acidic fluoride solution. However, the specific etchant and etching parameters can directly influence the structure and chemistry of the resultant MXene, which will ultimately affect functional properties. The etchant type, concentration, temperature, and starting particle size of MAX phase precursor have been shown to affect the required etching times and even the processing of MXenes can influence the atomic structure and surface functional chemistry. Therefore, optimizing synthesis methods requires a deep understanding of how these parameters influence the micro- and atomic structure of the resulting MXenes. In this chapter, we review advances from recent literature on the influence of synthesis methods on the crystal structure, nanopores, atomic defects, and surface functional group and discuss how the structure and defects influence properties of MXenes.KeywordsMXeneSynthesisEtchingScanning transmission electron microscopyAtomic defectsNanoporesSurface chemistry',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Two-dimensional (2D) MXenes based on early transition metal carbides and nitrides have highly tunable electrochemical properties including excellent catalytic activity for solar fuels generation.  These properties can be manipulated by modifying the basal plane chemistry.  In this presentation, we will describe our recent development of mixed transition metal nitride MXenes, M-Ti4N3Tx (M = V, Cr, Mo, or Mn; Tx = O and/or OH), by modifying pristine exfoliated Ti4N3Tx MXene with V, Cr, Mo, and Mn salts using a simple solution-based method. We will show that the transition metal alloying process induces highly tunable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalytic activity in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte as follows: V-Ti4N3Tx > Cr-Ti4N3Tx > Mo-Ti4N3Tx > Mn-Ti4N3Tx > pristine Ti4N3Tx with overpotentials as low as 330 mV at –10 mA cm–2. We further characterize these M-Ti4N3Tx MXenes using scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) to demonstrate that catalytic activity occurs on the basal plane, and additionally show that these MXenes exhibit semiconducting behavior. Lastly, we use in situ X-ray absorption spectroelectrochemistry to probe the transition metal oxidation states and unveil the mechanism of HER electrocatalysis.',\n",

In this study, a novel and original photocatalyst derived from the g-C3N4/amorphous Ti-peroxo complexes (CATC) heterojunction was successfully synthesized towards Rhodamine B (RhB) and tetracycline (TC) degradation under visible light irradiation (λ>420\\xa0nm). Based on the special photocatalytic activity, Ti3C2-Mxene acted as the starting precursor of amorphous Ti-peroxo complexes via one-step H2O2 oxidation route. Multiple characterization techniques were applied to explore the crystal structure, element composition, and photoelectrochemical property of photocatalyst. As expected, the modified photocatalyst possessed a favorable photocatalytic performance towards the preferable reaction rate for RhB (0.0483\\xa0min−1) and TC (0.0208\\xa0min−1) degradations, which were 16.65 times and 69.3 times higher than that of pure g-C3N4 (CN) material, profiting from the generated direct Z-scheme heterojunction with favorable redox capacity. Here, h+,∙O2- and ∙OH were verified as typical active radicals for RhB and TC degradation through free radical quenching experiments and electron spin resonance characterization. Degradation intermediate products were also confirmed by high performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometer (HPLC-MS). The effects of initial pH and ionic strength on RhB and TC photocatalytic degradation performances were discussed. In addition, a preferable reusability and stability performance ensured the modification photocatalyst had a great application potential in wastewater treatment. This study provided a unique avenue through one-step method for the construction of g-C3N4 and Mxene based photocatalyst towards the degradation of antibiotics and dyes from wastewater.Graphical AbstractDownload : Download high-res image (272KB)Download : Download full-size image',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'As a member of the MXene family, tungsten carbide (WC), with its unique physical structure and excellent optical properties, possesses enormous development potentials in ultrafast optoelectronics. In this letter, A WC film saturable absorber (SA) is successfully demonstrated to induce passive Q-switching in an erbium-doped fiber laser (EDFL). The WC nanoparticles (NPs) are synthesized by a hydrothermal method. Stable Q-switched pulses are generated at 1558 nm with a threshold pump power of 141 mW, after inserting the prepared WC film into the EDFL ring cavity. As the pump power ranges from 141 mW to 193 mW, the repetition rate increases from 32.34 kHz to 35.8 kHz, while the pulse duration decreases from \\n $5.5~\\\\mu \\\\text{s}$ \\n to \\n $4.16~\\\\mu \\\\text{s}$ \\n. When the pump power reaches a maximum power of 193 mW, the corresponding maximum pulse energy and output power are 81 nJ and 2.9 mW, respectively. To our best knowledge, this is the first report of utilizing WC as SA to achieve Q-switched pulses. Our research results provide a new reference for the realization of pulsed laser using MXene materials and reveal that WC has immense applications in nonlinear optics and ultrafast laser technology, which greatly broadens the frontier of materials for optoelectronic techniques.',\n",

SGP can generate electricity by salt concentration difference between two feeds without pollutant emission. One of the representative SGP systems is reverse electrodialysis (RED). An essential part of the RED system is the ion exchange membrane (IEM). However, the research on IEMs for RED, with low areal resistance and high permselectivity, is still lacking. This study proposes a cation exchange membrane (CEM) with engineering nanostructure and introducing new material. Nafion@MXene/Cellulose acetate (CA) composite CEM is fabricated by inspiration from the concrete structure of the building. The electrospun MXene/CA nanofiber is a framework, and the Nafion ionomer is a filler in structure. As a result, the Nafion@MXene/CA CEM shows better physical/electrochemical properties than the casted Nafion and layered membrane. In addition, the Nafion@MXene/CA CEM exhibits a higher power density (2.30\\xa0W\\xa0m−2) in the RED system than the commercial membrane, casted Nafion, and layered membrane.Graphical abstractHigh power generation through structural/material engineering.Download : Download high-res image (305KB)Download : Download full-size image',\n",

In particular, a prototype pouch cell of TiO2-C NS//NCM523 also demonstrates that TiO2-C NS as an anode material is a good match with commercial cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries. The good electrochemical performance of TiO2-C NS is attributed to the following factors: 1) the high surface area has abundant exposed active sites offering more Li+ insertion channels and short pathways of the Li+ and electrons; 2)\\xa0TiO2-C NS has structural stability and low volume expansion (<4%) during Li+ insertion and desertion; and 3) the nanostructure of TiO2-C NS prevents restacking and agglomerating by the surface-anchored TiO2 nanoparticles.

Herein we report on the intercalation of two-dimensional Ti3C2, Ti3CN and TiNbC—so called MXenes. Intercalation of hydrazine, and its co-intercalation with N,N-dimethylformamide, resulted in increases of the c-lattice parameters of surface functionalized f-Ti3C2, from 19.5 to 25.48 and 26.8\\u2009Å, respectively. Urea is also intercalated into f-Ti3C2. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that a hydrazine monolayer intercalates between f-Ti3C2 layers. Hydrazine is also intercalated into f-Ti3CN and f-TiNbC. When dimethyl sulphoxide is intercalated into f-Ti3C2, followed by sonication in water, the f-Ti3C2 is delaminated forming a stable colloidal solution that is in turn filtered to produce MXene ‘paper’. The latter shows excellent Li-ion capacity at extremely high charging rates.

These MXenes are used without delamination or any pre-treatment. Heat treatments accomplish the sacrificial transformation of these MXenes into TMD (NbS2) at 700 and 900 °C under H2S. This work investigates, for the first time, the role of starting MXene phase in the derivative morphology. It is shown that while treatment of Nb2C at 700 °C leads to the formation of pillar-like structures on the parent MXene, Nb4C3 produces nano-mosaic layered NbS2. At 900 °C, both MXene phases, of the same transition metal, fully convert into nano-mosaic layered NbS2 preserving the parent MXene's layered morphology. When tested as electrodes for hydrogen evolution reaction, Nb4C3-derived hybrids show better performance than Nb2C derivatives.

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\n\\nPotassium metal batteries are considered as attractive alternatives beyond lithium-ion batteries. However, uncontrollable dendrite growth on the potassium metal anode has restrained their practical applications. A high-performance potassium anode achieved by confining potassium metal into a titanium-deficient nitrogen-containing MXene/carbon nanotube freestanding scaffold is reported. The high electronic transport and fast potassium diffusion in this scaffold enable reduced local current density and homogeneous ionic flux during plating/stripping processes. Furthermore, as verified by theoretical calculations and experimental investigations, such “potassium-philic” MXene sheets can induce the nucleation of potassium, and guide potassium to uniformly distribute in the scaffold upon cycling. Consequently, the as-developed potassium metal anodes exhibit a dendrite-free morphology with high Coulombic efficiency and long cycle life during plating/stripping processes. Such anodes also deliver significantly improved electrochemical performances in potassium–sulfur batteries compared with bare potassium metal anodes. This work can provide a new avenue for developing potassium metal-based batteries.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\n               MXenes are an emergent class of two-dimensional materials with a very wide spectrum of promising applications. The synthesis of multiple MXenes, specifically solid-solution MXenes, allows fine tuning of their properties, expands their range of applications, and leads to enhanced performance. The functionality of solid-solution MXenes is closely related to the valence state of their constituents: transition metals, oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen. However, the impact of changes in the oxidation state of elements in MXenes is not well understood. In this work, three interrelated solid-solution MXene systems (Ti2−y\\n                  Nb\\n                     y\\n                  CT\\n                     x\\n                  , Nb2−y\\n                  V\\n                     y\\n                  CT\\n                     x\\n                  , and Ti2−y\\n                  V\\n                     y\\n                  CT\\n                     x\\n                  ) were investigated with scanning transmission electron microscopy and electron energy-loss spectroscopy to determine the localized valence states of metals at the nanoscale. The analysis demonstrates changes in the electronic configuration of V upon modification of the overall composition and within individual MXene flakes. These shifts of oxidation state can explain the nonlinear optical and electronic features of solid-solution MXenes. Vanadium appears to be particularly sensitive to modification of the valence state, while titanium maintains the same oxidation state in Ti–Nb and Ti–V MXenes, regardless of stoichiometry. The study also explains Nb’s influential role in the previously observed electronic properties in the Nb–V and Nb–Ti systems.',\n",

In this study, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) was used as a cross-linking agent leading to grow ZIF-67 on the surface of sepiolite (Sep) to increase the specific surface area and space volume of Sep. Subsequently, a hydrothermal synthesis method was used to form a stable superhydrophilic composite membrane from the composite MXene by polydopamine. Compared to the MPS composite membrane, the composite membrane with ZIF-67 exhibited improved hydrophilicity and heavy metal separation. In addition, the introduction of negatively charged SZ-24 increased the number of adsorption active sites and negative potential for the surface of the membrane, and this was conducive to the demulsification and adsorption of oil-water emulsions. The MSZ-1 composite membrane had excellent separation effects on surfactant-stabilised emulsions (SSEs) and surfactant-free emulsions (SFEs) oil-water emulsions. Furthermore, the separation effect on oil-water, under extreme water conditions, was greater than 99%. The MSZ-1 composite membrane can achieve excellent separation of heavy metal ions, especially Cu  2+  , under high flux and extreme conditions. Therefore, the MSZ-1 composite membrane has broad application prospects in oil-water treatment and heavy metal separation.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Photocatalytic removal of nitrate in wastewater has attracted wide attention because of its simple operation and environmental protection. However, the preparation of photocatalysts with high efficiency and high nitrogen selectivity is still a challenge. In this paper, TiO2 is grown in situ on Ti3C2 MXene by a simple calcination method and modified with silver particles. The presence of Ti3C2 reduces the recombination rate of photogenerated electrons and generates more photogenerated electrons. At the same time, the silver particles also increase the photoelectron density and further improve the carrier separation of the catalyst. Due to its unique structure and optical properties, the prepared photocatalyst shows an excellent nitrate removal rate under a high-pressure mercury lamp. At 500 mgN/L, the nitrate removal rate reaches 96.1%, and the nitrogen selectivity reaches 92.6%. Even after 5 cycles, the prepared photocatalyst still maintains a high nitrate photocatalytic removal efficiency (89%).

In this paper, multilayer porous MXene/COF composite membranes have been prepared by using straightforward electrostatic self-assembly of MXene and COF-LZU1. The optimal flexible MXene/COF 4:1 composite membrane shows a high water permeance of above 169.3 L m  -2  h  -1  bar  -1  under the separation test of five typical dye aqueous solutions, which are Methyl Green (MG), Ethyl Violet (EVT), Fuchsin Basic (FB), Crystal Violet (CV), Methylene Blue (MB). It also maintains high dyes rejection and water permeance under various pH systems (i.e. pH=3, 7 and 11) and two dye concentrations (i.e. 50 mg/L and 250 mg/L). In addition, the UV degradation study shows that MXene/COF 4:1 composite membrane can be recycled by exposing UV light without damage. Such outstanding dye separation performances can be due to its hierarchical heterogeneous structure containing micropores and mesopores, as well as its strong photothermal conversion ability. Our membrane may broaden the dye separation scope in both academic and industrial fields.',\n",

In this work, epoxy composites have been prepared with Ti3C2Tx, one of the most studied MXene materials that can be massively produced by direct etching using hydrofluoric acid. The addition of conductive two dimensional Ti3C2Tx platelet fillers leads to improved but anisotropic thermal conductivity of the composites. The through-plane thermal conductivity reaches 0.583 Wm−1K−1 and the in-plane thermal conductivity reaches 1.29 Wm−1K−1 when filler content is 40 wt% (21.3 vol%), achieving enhancements of 2.92 times and 10.65 times respectively, as compared with epoxy matrix. The dielectric permittivity of epoxy composite is enhanced by a factor of ~2.25 with 40 wt% fillers, and the dielectric losses are within a small value of 0.02. The results prove the effectiveness of Ti3C2Tx in simultaneously improving thermal and dielectric performance of epoxy composites, and it is deduced that further improvements may be obtained by using Ti3C2Tx nanoflake fillers.',\n",

In addition, GaIn liquid metal (LM) nanoparticles are also incorporated into the Ti3C2Tx/PANI microsphere to increase conductivity and stability. This method solves the existing problems of poor connectivity between LM nanoparticles and discontinuity of the Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets.

Non-reactive MD simulations provide high computational efficiency in simulations of large-scale systems and slow dynamics of electrode charging.

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\n\\nDesigning highly active and bifunctional oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts has attracted great interest toward metal–air batteries. Herein, an efficient solution to the search for MXene-based bifunctional catalysts is proposed by introducing non-noble metals such as Fe/Co/Ni at the surfaces. These results indicate that the ultrahigh activities in Ni1/Ni2- and Fe1/Ni2-modified MXene-based double-atom catalysts (DACs) for bifunctional ORR/OER are better than those of well-known unifunctional catalysts with low overpotentials, such as Pt(111) for the ORR and IrO2(110) for the OER. Strain can profoundly regulate the catalytic activities of MXene-based DACs, providing a novel pathway for tunable catalytic behavior in flexible MXenes. An electrochemical model, based on density functional theory and theoretical polarization curves, is proposed to reveal the underlying mechanisms, in agreement with experimental results. Electronic structure analyses indicate that the excellent catalytic activities in the MXene-based DACs are attributed to the electron-capturing capability and synergistic interactions between Fe/Co/Ni adsorbents and MXene substrate. These findings not only reveal promising candidates for MXene-based bifunctional ORR/OER catalysts but also provide new theoretical insights into rationally designing noble-metal-free bifunctional DACs.',\n",

However, challenges remain in terms of inefficient water transfer and vapor release, low solar absorption and conversion efficiency, and hydrophobic photothermal materials. Herein, enlightened by water transport through internal microchannels in trees, a tree-inspired hydrogel (TIH) with vertically aligned channels incorporating MXene as the light absorber is fabricated. Due to the vertically aligned channels, the rapid transfer of water and unobstructed release of steam can be achieved. Furthermore, water state in molecular meshes can be changed by polymer−water interaction, and partial water can be activated to promote water evaporation. Excellent internal photothermal conversion efficiency and hydrophilicity of MXene are also conducive to evaporation. As a result, TIH has achieved an evaporation rate of 2.71 kg m−2 h−1 and energy efficiency of 90.7% under one sun irradiation, which is higher than membrane material and structure-disordered hydrogel. This design principle, expandable manufacturing route, and excellent performance provide a potential way and design concept for water purification and desalination.',\n",

A major drawback of 2D nanomaterials is the re-stacking of the nanosheets, which prevents full utilization of surface area and blocks the access of the electrolyte. In this study, a free-standing nanocomposite paper electrode is realized by combining Mo1.33C MXene and positively charged biopolymer lignin (the second most abundant biopolymer in nature, L-DEA). The self-assembled layered architecture with alternating polymer and MXene flakes increases the interlayer space to promote ion transport, and with combining charge storage capability of the lignin derivative and MXene in an interpenetrating MXene/L-DEA nanocomposite, which offers an impressive capacitance of 503.7\\u2005F\\u2009g−1. Moreover, we demonstrate flexible solid-state asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) using Mo1.33C@L-DEA as the negative electrode and electrochemically exfoliated graphene with ruthenium oxide (EG@RuOx) as the positive electrode. This asymmetric device operates at a voltage window of 1.35\\u2005V, which is about two times wider than that of a symmetric Mo1.33C@L-DEA based supercapacitor.

Then, nanofluids with 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.08, 0.1, and 0.2 mass% concentrations of MXene nanoflakes were prepared, and their dynamic viscosity values were determined for a wide temperature range of 18–100\\xa0\\\\(^\\\\circ \\\\hbox {C}\\\\). The dynamic viscosity of the developed nanofluid, for each concentration, was found to be a strong function of temperature and decreased with increasing temperature. The effect of MXene nanoflakes concentration on the dynamic viscosity was found to be more significant at lower temperatures than at higher temperatures. A multilayer perceptron artificial neural network model was also developed in the study. To develop the model, temperature and nanoflakes concentration were given as inputs to the ANN model, whereas dynamic viscosity was the output of the model. The optimum model was found through the trial and error method. Statistical parameters such as mean square error, mean average percentage error, and correlation coefficient (R) were used to evaluate the performance of the developed model. The values of these parameters, for the optimum ANN model, were found to be 4.733E−05, 0.507%, and 0.99975, respectively. 95.67% of the deviations were also found to be in range of ±\\xa02%.

The cohesive energy, phonon dispersion, and melting point demonstrate high stability of Ti3C3. The mechanical properties are found to be even better than those of graphene in terms of Young's modulus and fracture strength. The metallicity of Ti3C3 indicates potential in metal-ion batteries.

The chemical compositions of the vast MXene family span a broad range of the periodic table, yet the optical spectra of only a handful of MXene compositions have been reported, and in only one example are the spectroscopic features assigned. The optical properties of nine carbide MXenes, representing a systematic variation of chemical composition and atomic structure are presented here. The observed optical phenomena span the UV to IR and include interband transitions and plasma excitations. The spectral features involving excitation of the plasma provide an optical readout of the composition-dependent carrier concentration, revealing even subtle changes due to modification of the surface chemistry. The high carrier concentration found in many MXenes differentiates them from other known 2D materials and the authors present evidence in favor of the hypothesis that MXenes host optically active plasmon resonances that naturally span the UV to near-IR, as a function of composition. This study introduces optical properties of novel MXenes, benefits the interpretation of 2D materials spectroscopy, and suggests the tremendous potential for this class of optoelectronic building blocks.',\n",

This study demonstrates the synthesis of orthorhombic Nb2O5@Nb4C3Tx (or @Nb2CTx) hierarchical composites via a one-step oxidation —in flowing CO2 at 850 °C —of 2D Nb4C3Tx (or Nb2CTx) MXene. The composites possess a layered architecture with orthorhombic Nb2O5 nanoparticles decorated uniformly on the surface of the MXene flakes and interconnected by disordered carbon. The composites have a capacity of 208 mAh g−1 at a rate of 50 mA g−1 (0.25 C) in 1–3 V versus Li+/Li, and retain 94% of the specific capacity with 100% Coulombic efficiency after 400 cycles. The good electrochemical performances could be attributed to three synergistic effects: (1) the high conductivity of the interior, unoxidized Nb4C3Tx layers, (2) the fast rate response and high capacity of the external Nb2O5 nanoparticles, and (3) the electron “bridge” effects of the disordered carbon. This oxidation method was successfully extended to Ti3C2Tx and Nb2CTx MXenes to prepare corresponding composites with similar hierarchical structures. Since this is an early report on producing this structure, there is much room to push the boundaries further and achieve better electrochemical performance.',\n",

However their use in electrochemical capacitors was only recently demonstrated (Lukatskaya et.al, Science, 2013).\\n               Here, we report on the intercalation of Li+, Na+, Mg2+, K+, NH4\\n                  +, and Al3+ ions between the 2D Ti3C2Tx layers. In most cases, the cations intercalated spontaneously. The intercalation of some ions, notably Al3+, can be promoted electrochemically. We also report on intercalation-induced high capacitance of >300 Farads per cubic centimeter (much higher than that of porous carbons) of flexible Ti3C2Tx paper electrodes in aqueous electrolytes. Material showed no degradation of the capacitive properties after more than 10,000 cycles. Several different electrochemical techniques were employed to understand the mechanism of charge storage, such as cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and EQCM.\\n               Lukatskaya, M.R., et al., Cation Intercalation and High Volumetric Capacitance of Two-Dimensional Titanium Carbide.

       "  'abstract': 'Flexible and binder-free hybrid materials can be prepared by combining nanosheets of graphene, graphene oxide, MXenes (two-dimensional transition metal carbides) and other 2D materials with carbon onions, carbon black, porous carbide-derived carbon nanoparticles, and nanotubes. This helps to overcome the tendency of 2D sheets to restack, which minimizes their surface area accessible to the electrolyte and hinders their overall performance in electrochemical applications. Nanospacers such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are often introduced between reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets to enhance the electrolyte accessibility and electronic conductivity of the film. However, there are opportunities to use other 2D nanosheet-nanoparticle combinations that provide the desired set of properties due to synergistic effects of the nanoparticles. A brief overview of the carbon-carbon and carbon-carbide hybrids will be provided in this talk. \\n               We have demonstrated fabrication of flexible, sandwich-like Ti3C2 MXene/CNT composite paper electrodes through alternating filtration of MXene and CNT dispersions. Spraying and other manufacturing methods can be used as well. Films containing onion- like carbon (OLC) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) were also fabricated and compared with those with CNTs. The sandwich-like electrodes exhibited significantly improved electrochemical performance compared to those of pure MXene and randomly mixed MXene/CNT papers. Examples of Li-ion battery and electrochemical capacitor electrodes will be provided. \\n               We also used highly porous carbide derived carbon (CDC) nanoparticles as spacers between graphene sheets and prepared rGO-CDC hybrid electrodes. The electrodes were made by thermal reduction of GO-CDC paper produced by vacuum-assisted filtration of aqueous solutions of GO-CDC composite containing 10-20 wt.% of CDC. Taking advantage of the high surface area and conductivity of rGO and the accessible pores of the CDC, the hybrid electrodes showed specific capacitances as high as 200-210 F/g at a scan rate of 100 mV/s. The addition of CDC between the rGO layers enhances the accessibility of electrodes to the electrolyte ions and good performance of the electrodes with the thickness to 40-50 μm was observed.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Recently, a family of layered ternary transition-metal carbides and/or nitrides, known as the MAX phases, received increasing attention as precursors for two-dimensional (2D) transition-metal carbides and/or nitrides known as MXenes. The MAX phases have the general formula Mn+1AXn, where n= 1 to 3 and M is an early transition metal, A is an A-group element, and X is carbon and/or nitrogen.1\\n                  -\\n                  2 By selectively etching the A-element layers from MAX phases, MXenes have been synthesized. Given that the MXene surfaces are terminated with OH, and F groups resulting from the etching process, it is more accurate to refer to them as Mn+1XnTx, where T represents the surface terminating groups, such as O, F and OH. There are more than 70 compounds known in the MAX family to date (plus dozens of solid solutions),3 most of which offer good electronic conductivity, lamellar structure, and temperature and environmental stability. As-prepared MXenes exist in a multilayered structure, which appears as stacked multilayer flakes. The multilayered structures can be delaminated into single-layer flakes by intercalation and/or sonication.4\\n                  -\\n                  5 Due to their high specific surface areas, metallic conductivity, and hydrophilic surfaces, MXenes have shown promising performance as electrodes for supercapacitors. MXenes are also promising anode materials for LIBs due to their excellent conductivity and cation intercalation capability.6\\n                  -\\n                  7 Nb4C3 MXene shows stable capacity, also at high rates (Figure 1). A capacity of 410 mAh g−1 for a Ti3C2 MXene “paper” anode at 1C rate without adding any binder has been reported. This Ti3C2 MXene “paper” was fabricated by intercalating Ti3C2 with dimethyl sulfoxide, bath sonication for 6 h, and filtering the Ti3C2 colloidal solution.8\\n                  -\\n                  9 The experimental procedure is very simple. MXene-based LIB anodes exhibited Li-ion capacity up to 800 mAh g−1, good rate performance, and excellent cycling stability.9\\n                  -\\n                  10 These results suggest a potential for MXene-supported hybrid electrodes for energy storage applications. \\n               By decreasing the particle size, we successfully demonstrated that not only MXenes but also their precursors - MAX phases, such as Ti2SC and Ti3SiC2, exhibit Li-ion storage capacity and show promise as LIB anode materials. Capacities of 180 and 150 mAh g−1 were achieved by submicrometer size Ti2SC and Ti3SiC2, respectively, accompanied by good cycle life and excellent rate performance.11 It opens the door to exploring a large family of potential anode materials. \\n               1.

       "  'abstract': 'A novel electrochemical non-enzymatic glucose sensor based on three-dimensional Au/MXene nanocomposites was developed. MXenes were prepared using the mild etched method, and the porous foam of Au nanoparticles was combined with the MXene by means of in situ synthesis. By controlling the mass of MXene in the synthesis process, porous foam with Au nanoparticles was obtained. The three-dimensional foam structure of nanoparticles was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were used to study the electrochemical performance of the Au/MXene nanocomposites. The Au/MXene nanocomposites acted as a fast redox probe for non-enzymatic glucose oxidation and showed good performance, including a high sensitivity of 22.45 μA mM−1 cm−1 and a wide linear range of 1–12 mM. Studies have shown that MXene as a catalyst-supported material is beneficial to enhance the conductivity of electrons and increase the loading rate of the catalyst materials. The foam structure with Au nanoparticles can provide a larger surface area, increase the contact area with the molecule in the catalytic reaction, and enhance the electrochemical reaction signal. In summary, this study showed that Au/MXene nanoparticles have the potential to be used in non-enzymatic glucose sensors.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\n\\n2D transition metal carbides and/or nitrides (MXenes) have attracted enormous attention because of their potential applications in energy storage, catalysis, and others. The control of surface terminations is generally believed to offer the potential preparation approaches to novel MXenes, while an external strain may provide solution to property modification. However, an atomistic understanding on the stabilization of surface complexity and the influence of strain on electrochemical properties of MXenes are scarce yet much demanded. Herein, taking Ti2CTn as a representative MXene, the thermodynamically favorable configurations are explored with a mixture of functional groups under various electrochemical environments. It predicts that five thermodynamically preferable Ti2CTn terminated by O\\uf8ff and F\\uf8ff cofunctionalized groups are discovered, all of which show excellent mechanical flexibility and strength that appear a decreasing trend as increasing F/O ratio. Further investigations on strain-controllable Li-transport of these cofunctionalized Ti2CT2 indicate that a mixture of surface terminations decreases the diffusion barriers, while the uniaxial strain modifies the diffusion pathways of Li atom owing to asymmetrical surface geometry and electronic polarization. These findings provide a view on the modification of properties by controlling surface complexity, demonstrating effective pathways in designing MXenes by electrochemical approach and tuning electrochemical property by strains.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\n\\nAt present, the main gas-sensing mechanism of oxidized MXene (Ti3C2Tx) is commonly regarded as Schottky barrier modulation, but the influence of surface defects generated by oxidation is ignored and ambiguous. Herein, oxidized Ti3C2Tx crumpled spheres (MS) are obtained, accompanying numerous surface defects through thermal oxidation of MS synthesized by ultrasonic spray pyrolysis technology and gas-sensing properties of oxidized MS with Ti3C2Tx/TiO2 crumpled spheres (MT-10-1) without new surface defects are compared. It is demonstrated that the significant improvement of the gas-sensing properties of oxidized MS is due to the introduction of Ti atom defects rather than Ti3C2Tx/TiO2 heterojunction in-situ generated by oxidation. First-principles density functional theory calculations show that Ti atom vacancy can greatly improve the adsorption ability of Ti3C2Tx to gases (especially for NO2). Subsequently, with the facile oxidability, Ti3C2Tx is utilized as a reductant to assist the reduction of graphene oxide, and Ti3C2Tx/TiO2/rGO crumpled spheres are subtly designed and successfully synthesized for further enhancing the gas-sensing performance. The MG-2-1 sensor achieves a low detection limit of NO2 (10 ppb), great NO2 selectivity, and high NO2 response. The clarification of the gas-sensing mechanism of oxidized Ti3C2Tx and the utilization of oxidation of Ti3C2Tx provide a new idea for the application of MXenes.',\n",

Paradoxically, the overproduction and/or mismanagement of ROS have been involved in pathogenesis and progression of various human diseases. Here, we reported a two-dimensional (2D) vanadium carbide (V2C) MXene nanoenzyme (MXenzyme) that can mimic up to six naturally-occurring enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), thiol peroxidase (TPx) and haloperoxidase (HPO). Based on these enzyme-mimicking properties, the constructed 2D V2C MXenzyme not only possesses high biocompatibility but also exhibits robust in vitro cytoprotection against oxidative stress. Importantly, 2D V2C MXenzyme rebuilds the redox homeostasis without perturbing the endogenous antioxidant status and relieves ROS-induced damage with benign in vivo therapeutic effects, as demonstrated in both inflammation and neurodegeneration animal models. These findings open an avenue to enable the use of MXenzyme as a remedial nanoplatform to treat ROS-mediated inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases.',\n",

Their unique combination of metallic conductivity, hydrophilicity, and highly charged surfaces endow them with excellent electrochemical performance. Appropriate surface functional groups determine their semiconducting properties.

In addition, the discovery of 2D organic semiconductors having single molecular thickness has also greatly attracted research attention due to their optical, electronic, optoelectronic, and mechatronic properties. Moreover, the formation of MXenes/organic 2D heterostructures enables many interesting phenomena in the 2D quantum limit to be observed.

Lightweight layered foam/film PVDF nanocomposites with efficient EMI shielding effectiveness and ultralow reflection power were fabricated by physical foaming. The unique layered foam/film structure was composed of PVDF/SiCnw/MXene (Ti3C2Tx) composite foam as absorption layer and highly conductive PVDF/MWCNT/GnPs composite film as a reflection layer. The foam layer with numerous heterogeneous interfaces developed between the \\ufeffSiC nanowires (SiCnw) and 2D MXene nanosheets imparted superior EM wave attenuation capability. Furthermore, the microcellular structure effectively tuned the impedance matching and prolonged the wave propagating path by internal scattering and multiple reflections. Meanwhile, the highly conductive PVDF/MWCNT/GnPs composite (~\\u2009220 S m−1) exhibited superior reflectivity (R) of 0.95. The tailored structure in the layered foam/film PVDF nanocomposite exhibited an EMI SE of 32.6\\xa0dB and a low reflection bandwidth of 4\\xa0GHz (R\\u2009<\\u20090.1) over the Ku-band (12.4\\u2009−\\u200918.0\\xa0GHz) at a thickness of 1.95\\xa0mm. A peak SER of 3.1\\u2009×\\u200910–4\\xa0dB was obtained which corresponds to only 0.0022% reflection efficiency. In consequence, this study introduces a feasible approach to develop lightweight, high-efficiency EMI shielding materials with ultralow reflection for emerging applications.',\n",

Here we report a bottom-up approach to the preparation of a two-dimensional (2D) Ti3C2Tx MXene-polydopamine heterostructure having ordered in-plane mesochannels (denoted as mPDA/MXene). Interfacial self-assembly of mesoporous polydopamine (mPDA) monolayers on MXene nanosheets leads to the mPDA/MXene heterostructure, which exhibits several unique features: (1)\\u2005MXene undergoes reversible ion intercalation/deintercalation and possesses high conductivity; (2)\\u2005mPDA layers establish redox capacitive characteristics and Na+ selectivity, and also help to prevent self-stacking and oxidation of MXene; (3)\\u2005in-plane mesochannels enable the smooth transport of ions at the internal spaces of this stacked 2D material.

An appealing solution to this problem is to utilize CO2 as feedstock to generate useful chemicals, e.g., fuel, hydrocarbons, and valuable chemicals. The chemical inertness of CO2 needs considerably large energy for its conversion into useful chemicals. Therefore, CO2 reduction reaction requires an effective catalyst for its conversion into fuel (methanol, methane) and industrial chemicals (syngas, formic acid). Recently, two-dimensional layers of early transition metal carbides and nitrides, called MXene, have shown potential for catalysis due to its exposed transition metal sites, and mechanical and chemical stability at high temperatures.

Since their discovery in 2011, about 30 different MXenes have been synthesized, and the structure and properties of several dozens have been predicted by first-principles approaches. Given the outstanding advances in the MXene field, it is thus appropriate to review the most relevant properties of these MXenes and point out their potential applications. In this article, the structural, transport, magnetic, vibrational, mechanical, and electrochemical properties of MXenes are overviewed. The goal is to illustrate how the chemical versatility in the intrinsic composition and surface terminations combined with the potential addition of a fourth element enable to tune MXenes properties to meet the targeted applications.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"As a new two-dimensional material, MXene has caused extensive research in field of supercapacitor, electromagnetic shielding, strain sensing field due to its excellent mechanical properties and electrical conductivity. MXene with good water dispersibility can be used as an ideal nano-material to enhance the conductivity of hydrogels. However, MXene is easy to accumulate in the hydrogel system, and there are rare articles on MXene hydrogels. In this paper, we combine cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) and MXene to prepare CNC/MXene nanosheets and take advantage of CNC’s excellent dispersibility in water and the electrostatic repulsion between CNCs to avoid the accumulating of MXene and enhance the mechanical properties of the hydrogel. Based on it, we prepared a physical–chemical double crosslinking and double-network CNC/MXene hydrogel by in situ polymerization and cycle freeze-thaw method. The CNC/MXene hydrogel we prepared exhibited excellent mechanical properties; it could be stretched to 7 times its original length and could reach 1.025\\xa0MPa tensile stress. When the compression strain was 80%, the compression stress could reach 1.1\\xa0MPa. After unloading the compression pressure, it could rapidly return to its original length within 0.17\\xa0s, which would impact greatly on the practical application of CNC/MXene hydrogel. What's more, the conductivity of it was up to 0.4 S/m and the thermal conductivity was 0.38\\xa0W/mK. So, the hydrogel prepared by us has a wide range of application prospects in the fields of human motion monitoring, electronic skin, man–machine interface, etc.\",\n",

Interestingly, this study shows that the magnetic and electronic properties of Cr2C with F and OH functional groups (i.e., Cr2CF(OH), with one functional group on each side) can be predicted using previously known properties of Cr2C with only one kind of functional group (i.e., either F or OH on both sides). Unlike typical functionalized 2D materials with different functional groups, each functional group of Cr2CF(OH) has a negligible effect on the magnetic and electronic properties of the other side. This unique phenomenon results from the small differences in geometry between the functional groups, such as the coordination number, bond length, and thickness; the properties themselves come from those of Cr2CF2 and Cr2C(OH)2, despite having different functional groups. Due to the preserved magnetic moments of the Cr atoms bound with each functional group, Cr2CF(OH) exhibits ferrimagnetism. Likewise, semiconducting characters are present because the atomic contributions of each energy level from Cr2CF2 and Cr2C(OH)2 are maintained. Thus, the present work demonstrates that a combination of functional groups that shows certain desired properties can be selected when designing Cr2C-based spintronic and electronic devices.',\n",

However, the photothermal conversion mechanism of MXenes is still poorly understood. Here, by using femtosecond visible and mid-infrared transient absorption spectroscopy, the electronic energy dissipation dynamics of MXene (Ti3C2Tx) nanosheets dispersed in various solvents are carefully studied. Our results indicate that the lifetime of photoexcited MXene is strongly dependent on the surrounding environment. Especially, the interfacial electron-vibration coupling between the MXene nanosheets and the adjacent solvent molecules is directly observed following the ultrafast photoexcitation of MXene. It suggests that the interfacial interactions at the MXene-solvent interface play a critical role in the ultrafast energy transport dynamics of MXene, which offers a potentially feasible route for tailoring the light conversion properties of 2D systems.',\n",

The results provide not only a high-performance lithium storage material, but also an effective strategy that could address the intrinsic issues of various transition metal oxides by anchoring them on MXene nanosheets to form heterostructures and use as anode materials for LIBs.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The electronic and magnetic properties of Titanium and one of its oxide Anatase are calculated by using Tight Binding Linear Muffin-Tin Orbital Atomic Sphere Approximation (TB-LMTO-ASA) method under Density Functional Theory (DFT). The lattice parameter, band structure, Density of States (DOS) and charge density distributions of Ti and TiO2 (Anatase) required for electronic structure are calculated respectively. The orbital contribution is analyzed by fat band structure; the d- orbital on conduction band and, s and p orbitals on valance bands. Consequently, their magnetic properties are checked. From our study, we found that the magnetic moments of Ti and TiO2 are found to be 2.2 μB and 0 respectively. The total Density of States for spin up and down electron have smaller difference in Ti and symmetric in TiO2 indicates that Ti slightly paramagnetic and Anatase is non magnetic in nature. The charge density plots reveals the concentration of electrons at the site under study. Anatase can be deposited onto Mxene to form Mxene-Anatase nanocomposite which has several excellent applications in the field of biosensors, biocompatible materials, energy storage devices, topological insulators etc.',\n",

In this paper, we theoretically investigated the quantum capacitance, electronic and optical properties of pristine Sc2CF2 and the vacancy-doping Sc2CF2 monolayers by first principles calculations. Pristine Sc2CF2 is the most stable structure among the four investigated systems according to the analysis of binding energy, and the introduction of vacancy does not improve the stability of the system. The introduction of vacancy produced the defect energy levels, which pass through the Fermi energy level and result in the semiconductor–metal transition. For Pristine Sc2CF2, the introduction of VSc results in the strong magnetism with 1.0 μB, which is mainly from the contribution of C-pz, Sc-dz2, Sc-dxz states. The analysis of optical properties indicates that the introduction of the vacancy not only makes the system more sensitive to the infrared light, but also improves the reflectivity, especially in the infrared region. The introduction of vacancy improves the Cdiff of the systems at 0\\xa0V, and drastically increases the maximum Cint of the vacancy-doping systems. Charge transfer is further explored.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\n\\nLithium–sulfur batteries (Li-S batteries) are promising next-generation energy storage systems because of their high-theoretical energy density. However, the commercialization of Li-S batteries is still impeded by the aggregation of sulfur, low-sulfur utilization, shuttling of dissolved polysulfides and sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, we designed a hierarchically maple leaf-like structured sulfur electrodes by in-situ growth of ultrathin sulfur microcrystal on two-dimensional MXene-graphene-cellulose nanofiber (MGN) matrice (denoted as IS-MGN@S). The sulfur microcrystal as cathode can achieve improved kinetics than bulk sulfur due to its few layers of sulfur atoms, which is proved by the density functional theory calculations. The MXene not only confines polysulfides through strong chemisorption but also promotes the catalytic conversion of polysulfides. The introduction of graphene improves the conductivity and boosts the immobilization and conversion of polysulfides. As a result, the IS-MGN@S cathode demonstrates remarkable electrochemical properties with a high-initial capacity (1229 mAh g−1 at 0.2C), substantial improvement in rate capability (770 mAh g−1 at 2C), and stable long-term cycling capacity. Moreover, the pouch cells with IS-MGN@S cathode and gel electrolyte demonstrate excellent mechanical properties under mechanical damage (nail & cut tests, severe deformations), suggesting their promising applications for wearable electronic devices.',\n",

This largely affects the performance and stability of such membranes. Here, we have used first-principle density functional theory calculations to conduct a comparative study of two heterostructural bilayer systems of the 2D-MXene (Ti3C2T2, T = F, O, and OH) sheets with graphene and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). For all considered surface terminations, the binding energy of the MXene/graphene and MXene/AgNPs bilayers increases as compared with graphene/graphene and MXene/MXene bilayer structures. Such strong interlayer interactions are due to profound variations of electrostatic potential across the layers. Larger interlayer binding energies in MXene/graphene systems were obtained even in the presence of water molecules, indicating enhanced stability of such a hybrid system against delamination. We also studied the structural properties of Ti3C2X2 MXene (X = F, O and OH) decorated with silver nanoclusters Agn (n ≤ 6). We found that regardless of surface functionalization, Ag nanoclusters were strongly adsorbed on the surface of MXene. In addition, Ag nanoparticles enhanced the binding energy between MXene layers.

       "  'abstract': 'Electrochemical energy storage (EES) and conversion devices (e.g. batteries, supercapacitors, and reactors) are emerging as primary methods for global efforts to shift energy dependence from limited fossil fuels towards sustainable and renewable resources. These electric-based devices, while showing great potential for meeting some key metrics set by conventional technologies, still face significant limitations. For example, an EES device tends to exhibit large energy density (e.g. lithium-ion battery) or power density (e.g. supercapacitor), but not both. This inability of a single device to simultaneously achieve both metrics represents a major obstacle to widespread adoption of EES devices. Improvements in materials, such as the integration of 2D materials (e.g. graphene, dichalcogenides, MXene, etc.) into electrochemical devices has yielded some exciting results towards tackling this issue, but significant improvements are still needed. Our approach to simultaneously achieving high energy and power density is to focus on one of the fundamental processes that occur in these systems: mass (or charge) transport. The efficient transport of ions within EES devices is critical to realizing both large power and energy densities. The pore structure of the electrode is a key factor in determining this transport phenomena, but in many cases, engineering the pore structure in a highly deterministic fashion is not pursued or even possible for many electrode materials. In this work, we explore a number of additive manufacturing methods (e.g. direct ink write, projection microstereolithography, etc.) to engineer the pore structure of device electrodes. We also determine effective electrode geometries using both simple theory and topology optimization techniques. The topology optimization couples the solution of the forward electrochemical problem over the full electrode domain with gradient-based optimization. The output of our code is a three-dimensional CAD representation which optimizes over specific performance metrics and which can be used to print functional electrodes. This work provides a systematic path toward automatic design and fabrication of engineered electrodes with precise control over the fluid and species distribution.\\n               This work was performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'There has been considerable effort to develop wearable electronics from life-supporting devices for solders to fashion accessories such as smartwatches. The research of gas sensor has also attempted to adapt wearables with the power of nanotechnology. On the wearable platform, miniature gas sensors will provide real-time information about the atmosphere to protect each personnel from possible hazardous chemical attacks. In addition, wearable gas sensor can be facilitated to monitor human’s breath as medical applications. [1] One of the important factors to develop wearable gas sensors is to operate at room temperature with excellent sensing performance. Recently, two-dimensional (2D) nanostructured materials have been highlighted as new sensing materials due to their working ability at low temperatures. Unlike conventional metal oxides, 2D materials such as graphene are able to work at room temperature with comparable gas response to NO2 gas. However, insufficient sensing performance, such as sluggish recovery and low gas response, need to be developed. [2] As one attempt to enhance performance, 2D material was hybridized with metal oxide. By incorporating two nanostructured materials, synergistic effect, which comes from benefits of each material, can improve sensing performance. [3] Another novel innovation is the introduction of newly discovered 2D materials. 2D transition metal carbides and/or carbonitrides (called MXenes) are a new family of 2D materials. The vast diversity in a combination of constituent elements and ordered structure in MXenes offers future possibilities to find out a new generation of sensing materials with their superior performance. [4, 5]\\n               In this study, different types of 2D nanostructured materials and their hybrids were investigated for the breath analysis of various volatile compounds. Graphene oxide (GO) was incorporated with TiO2 nanoparticles, and the composite was photo-reduced under UV irradiation. Room temperature gas sensing was carried out against various VOC gases, and sensing performance was evaluated by comparing with pure GO. With the tailored hetero-junction at the interfaces of GO and TiO2, the composite can identify ethanol, methanol, and acetone, and its gas response was enhanced. In addition, we introduced new 2D nanostructured materials, MXenes including Ti3C2Tx and V2CTx. 2D V2CTx gas sensors showed excellent gas-sensing performance in terms of high response toward non-polar gases. Compared to the sensing properties of Ti3C2Tx MXene, 2D V2CTx sensor showed higher selectivity and long-term stability. The comparative results suggest that the modification of ordered structure and constituent elements of MXenes play a pivot role in the interaction between analyte and MXenes leading to an extensive change designed to detect individual compounds.

       "  'abstract': 'Introduction\\n               \\n                With the rapid development of the chemical industry, the emission of the harmful NH3 has increased significantly, thus the research of high performance NH3 sensors has attracted extensive attention of the researchers [1]. Over the past decades, the emergence of novel materials has brought opportunities for the development of gas sensors. As a representative of another new family of materials, the 2D transition metal carbides, carbonitrides and nitrides (MXenes) have attracted great attention of the researchers in the field of gas sensors due to their unique chemical and physical properties being recently realized [2]. Taking the well-studied Ti3C2T\\n                     x\\n                   MXene as an example, it has been proved theoretically and experimentally that the Ti3C2T\\n                     x\\n                   has gas sensing properties at room temperature, especially for NH3 [3]. However, its NH3 sensing properties still need to be enhanced. In this work, the gas sensor based on TiO2/Ti3C2T\\n                     x\\n                   composite film is fabricated by a simple spraying method and its NH3 sensing properties are investigated at room temperature.\\n               \\n                  Method\\n               \\n                The 2D Ti3C2T\\n                     x\\n                   nanosheets were prepared through etching Al from Ti3AlC2 in diluted HF and Tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAOH) solutions [4]. TiO2 nanoparticles in water dispersion were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The gas sensors were fabricated by a simple spray method. In brief, 0.4 mL diluted TiO2 nanoparticles solution (5 mg/mL) was sprayed on the polyimide (PI) substrate with seven pairs of Au interdigitated electrodes (electrodes width and distance: 0.2 mm) and dried at 60°C for 10 min for forming the TiO2 film. Then, 1 mL diluted Ti3C2T\\n                     x\\n                   nanosheets solution (2 mg/mL) was sprayed on the surface of the TiO2 film for fabricating TiO2-supported Ti3C2T\\n                     x\\n                   film gas sensor. For comparison, the gas sensors based on pure TiO2 nanoparticles (0.4 mL) and Ti3C2T\\n                     x\\n                   nanosheets (1 mL) were prepared by the same approach. The gas sensing properties of the sensors were tested at different NH3 concentration with 60.8% RH.\\n               \\n                  Results and Conclusions\\n               \\n                Figure 1a shows the XRD patterns of the three samples, which the diffraction peaks match with the previous reports [5], indicating high purity of the Ti3C2T\\n                     x\\n                   and anatase TiO2. From the TEM image of the Ti3C2T\\n                     x\\n                   in Fig. 1b, Ti3C2T\\n                     x\\n                   is of few-layer nanosheet structure, proving that Ti3C2T\\n                     x\\n                   nanosheets is successfully prepared. Figure 1c shows the normalized response-recovery curves of three sensors to 10 ppm NH3. As can be seen, there is no NH3 response for the pure TiO2 sensor, and the responses of the Ti3C2T\\n                     x\\n                   and TiO2/Ti3C2T\\n                     x\\n                   sensors are about 1.9% and 3.1%, respectively. Compare with Ti3C2T\\n                     x\\n                   sensor, the baseline resistance of TiO2/Ti3C2T\\n                     x\\n                   sensor is more stable, and the enhanced response of TiO2/Ti3C2T\\n                     x\\n                   sensor is 1.63 times than that of pure Ti3C2T\\n                     x\\n                   sensor. Fig. 1d shows the good dynamic response-recovery curve of the TiO2/ Ti3C2T\\n                     x\\n                   sensor to different concentrations NH3 and the sensor can even respond to NH3 as low as 0.5 ppm.\\n                In summary, we rationally designed the gas sensor based on based on TiO2/Ti3C2T\\n                     x\\n                   bilayer film for enhancing the NH3 sensing properties of pure 2D Ti3C2T\\n                     x\\n                   nanosheets and the results show that the response value and response/recovery speeds of TiO2/Ti3C2T\\n                     x\\n                   sensor are evidently improved. Meanwhile, the enhanced NH3 sensing response of the TiO2/Ti3C2T\\n                     x\\n                   sensor is explained by the model of self-built electric field (space charge layer) regulation. This work demonstrates that Ti3C2T\\n                     x\\n                   nanosheets supported by TiO2 nanoparticles can be used to enhance the NH3 sensing response, which is expected to provide useful reference for the development of high performance Ti3C2T\\n                     x\\n                  -based NH3 sensors.\\n               \\n                  References \\n               \\n               [1] S.

       "  'abstract': 'High conductivity two-dimensional (2D) materials have been proved to be potential electrode materials for flexible supercapacitors because of its outstanding chemical and physical properties. However, electrodes based on 2D materials always suffer from limited electrolyte-accessible surface due to the restacking of the 2D sheets, hindering the full utilization of their surface area. In this regard, an electrolyte-mediated method is used to integrate dense structure reduced graphene oxide/MXene (RGM)-electrolyte composite films. In such composite films, reduced graphene oxide (RGO) and MXene sheets are controllable assembly in compact layered structure with electrolyte filled between the layers. The electrolyte layer between RGO and MXene sheets forms continuous ion transport channels in the composite films. Therefore, the RGM-electrolyte composite films can be used directly as self-supporting electrodes for supercapacitors without additional conductive agents and binders. As a result, the composite films demonstrate enhanced volumetric specific capacity, improved volumetric energy density and higher power density compared with both pure RGO electrode and porous composite electrode prepared by traditional methods. Specifically, when the mass ratio of MXene is 30%, the electrode delivers a volumetric specific capacity of 454.9 F·cm−3 with a high energy density of 39.4 Wh·L−1. More importantly, supercapacitors based on the composite films exhibit good flexibility electrochemical performance. The investigation provides a new approach to synthesize dense structure films based on 2D materials for application in high volumetric capacitance flexible supercapacitors.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\n\\n2D transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes) have gained extensive attention recently due to their versatile surface chemistry, layered structure, and intriguing properties. The assembly of MXene sheets into macroscopic architectures is an important approach to harness their extraordinary properties. However, it is difficult to construct a freestanding, mechanically flexible, and 3D framework of MXene sheets owing to their weak intersheet interactions. Herein, an interfacial enhancement strategy to construct multifunctional, superelastic, and lightweight 3D MXene architectures by bridging individual MXene sheets with polyimide macromolecules is developed. The resulting lightweight aerogel exhibits superelasticity with large reversible compressibility, excellent fatigue resistance (1000 cycles at 50% strain), 20% reversible stretchability, and high electrical conductivity of ≈4.0 S m−1. The outstanding mechanical flexibility and electrical conductivity make the aerogel promising for damping, microwave absorption coating, and flexible strain sensor. More interestingly, an exceptional microwave absorption performance with a maximum reflection loss of −45.4 dB at 9.59 GHz and a wide effective absorption bandwidth of 5.1 GHz are achieved.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Developing strategies for atomic-scale controlled synthesis of new two-dimensional (2D) functional materials will directly impact\\xa0their applications. Here, using in situ aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy, we obtain direct insight into the homoepitaxial Frank–van der Merwe atomic layer growth mechanism of TiC single adlayers synthesized on surfaces of Ti3C2 MXene substrates with the substrate being the source material. Activated by thermal exposure and electron-beam irradiation, hexagonal TiC single adlayers form on defunctionalized surfaces of Ti3C2 MXene at temperatures above 500\\u2009°C, generating new 2D materials Ti4C3 and Ti5C4. The growth mechanism for a single TiC adlayer and the energies that govern atom migration and diffusion are elucidated by comprehensive density functional theory and force-bias Monte Carlo/molecular dynamics simulations. This work could lead to the development of bottom-up synthesis methods using substrates terminated with similar hexagonal-metal surfaces, for controllable synthesis of larger-scale and higher quality single-layer transition metal carbides. Understanding bottom-up growth mechanisms of 2D transition metal carbides (MXenes) may enable new synthetic routes to tailor functional properties. Here, the authors use in situ electron microscopy, density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulations to reveal the homoepitaxial growth mechanisms of a single TiC adlayer from a Ti3C2 monolayer substrate.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Ti3C2Tx MXene with good thermal conductivity and microwave absorption (MA) properties is an attractive candidate used in 5G communication applications to dissipate the accumulated heat and absorb electromagnetic energy. Ti3C2Tx has good MA properties partially due to the contribution of the polarization loss induced by the surface terminations; however, these terminations, especially the −F, are easily removed under thermal environment. To investigate the influence of the annealing conditions on the MA properties, Ti3C2Tx was vacuum-annealed at 150, 350, and 550\\xa0°C, respectively, for 1\\xa0h. The 150\\xa0°C-annealed Ti3C2Tx demonstrated the best reflection loss (RL) value of −\\xa015.10\\xa0dB at 9.92\\xa0GHz as compared with the pristine Ti3C2Tx (−\\xa011.07\\xa0dB at 7.92\\xa0GHz) and resultant products annealed at 350\\xa0°C (−\\xa03.60\\xa0dB at 13.68\\xa0GHz) and 550\\xa0°C (−\\xa04.97\\xa0dB at 11.28\\xa0GHz). Annealing at 150\\xa0°C for 1\\xa0h removed part of −F, but tuned the impedance matching of Ti3C2Tx, thus improving the MA properties. Further prolonging the annealing time from 1 to 4\\xa0h at 150\\xa0°C induced a slight deterioration on the MA properties mainly due to −F desorption. This work confirms the application temperature of Ti3C2Tx as an attractive MA material used in 5G communication.',\n",

Until now, different kinds of electronic devices have been proposed in the realization of biological synapse functions. However, the device stability and the power consumption are major challenges for future industrialization applications. Herein, an electronic synapse of MXene/SiO2 structure-based resistive random-access memory (RRAM) devices has been designed and fabricated by taking advantage of the desirable properties of SiO2 and 2D MXene material. The proposed RRAM devices, Ag/MXene/SiO2/Pt, exhibit the resistance switching characteristics where both the volatile and nonvolatile behaviors coexist in a single device. These intriguing features of the Ag/MXene/SiO2/Pt devices make them more applicable for emulating biological synaptic plasticity. Additionally, the conductive mechanisms of the Ag/MXene/SiO2/Pt RRAM devices have been discussed on the basis of our experimental results.',\n",

In this study, a method is proposed to deconvolute and quantify the real-time fluxes and ionic currents of different species based on the EQCM measurement results. This work creatively conceptualizes the flux cyclic voltammograms (CVs) and ionic current CVs, and applys them to analyze the real-time molecules and ion evolution. As a proof of concept, Ti3C2Tx MXene, the most studied 2D metal carbide, is investigated as a supercapacitor electrode in 1 m H2SO4 electrolyte. The real-time H2O and H+ fluxes are obtained using the proposed approach and corresponding flux CVs are constructed. The potential-dependent evolution of H2O and H+ fluxes suggest that the insertion of hydrated H+ contributes significantly to the double-layer capacitance. The H+ CV calculated from the H+ flux overlaps with the experimental measured CV, confirming that H+ is the only interactive charge carrier for screening the Ti3C2Tx electrode charge.',\n",

However, the re-stacking and surface functionalization attached on the MXenes surface in the anode electrode severely restrict the accessibility to electrolyte ions, hindering the full utilization of their intrinsic properties. To address this challenge, the Sn@Ti3C2 materials of three dimensional (3D) are rationally designed and fabricated in unique layer-by-layer manner through self-assembly for boosting LIBs. In this design system for fast lithium-ion storage, the Ti3C2 MXene nanosheets serving as 3D scaffolds buffer Sn nanoparticles' severe volume expansion, agglomeration and enhance electrode conductivity at the interface. Furthermore, Sn nanoparticles are embedded as interlayer spacers to prevent the re-stacking of nanosheets and provide outstanding electrochemical performance. The nanostructure can increase the lithium-ion diffusion coefficient and create additional active sites. As a result, the Sn@Ti3C2 anode exhibits a superior specific capacity of up to 577 mA h g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 after 100 cycles. Comparing with pure Sn, the improved electrochemical performance of Sn@Ti3C2 can be ascribed to the high electronic conductivity of Ti3C2 MXene nanosheets.

Accurate analysis of D2HG could help rapid diagnosis of these diseases and allow for timely treatment. In this work, a D-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase from Ralstonia solanacearum (RsD2HGDH) is cloned and recombinantly expressed. This enzyme features the direct electron transfer to chemical electron mediators (such as methylene blue (MB)) in the absence of additional coenzymes. Therefore, NAD+, a natural electron acceptor for the commercial D2HGDH and usually known for being unstable and difficult for immobilization can be avoided in the preparation of biosensors. The RsD2HGDH and MB are co-immobilized on a two-dimensional material, Ti3C2 MXene, followed by drop-coating on the gold screen-printed electrode (AuSPE) to construct a compact and portable biosensor. The D2HG in samples can be catalyzed by RsD2HGDH, where the current change is measured by chronoamperometry at −0.23 V. The biosensor shows a D2HG detection range of 0.5 to 120 µM (R2 = 0.9974) with a sensitivity of 22.26 μA mM−1 cm−2 and a detection limit of 0.1 µM (S/N = 3). The biosensor retains 72.52% performance of its incipient state after 30 days of storage. The samples of D2HG-containing fetal bovine serum and artificial urine were analyzed with the recovery of 99.56% to 106.83% and 97.30% to 102.47% further indicating the great application potential of our portable D2HG biosensor.',\n",

The Ti3C2Tx/poly(2-(dimethylamino) ethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA) nanocomposite hydrogel exhibits an ionic conductivity of 1.6\\u2009mS\\u2009cm−1, and a super adhesive strength of 5041\\u2009kPa to the copper substrate. The resultant hydrogel also exhibits fast automatic self-healing ability due to the hydrogen bonds between Ti3C2Tx and PDMAEMA chains. This work provides a new method to synthesize the robust MXene-based environmentally sensitive nanocomposite adhesive hydrogels.',\n",

Newly emerged 2-dimensional transition-metal carbides (MXenes) are promising for efficient EMI shielding due to their superb electrical conductivity, versatile surface chemistry, and layered structure. However, the mechanical performance of MXene films is not satisfactory for engineering applications, and the traditional reinforcement approaches usually cause serious reduction in electrical conductivity of the films. An efficient strategy is demonstrated to reinforce MXene films with graphene oxide, leading to enhanced interfacial interactions and more densely packed layered structures. The modified MXene film exhibits a high tensile strength of 209 MPa while maintaining its high electrical conductivity close to that of pristine MXene film. An outstanding shielding effectiveness of 50.2 dB is achieved at a small film thickness of 7 µm. Moreover, a facile technique is used to tune the wetting behavior of the modified MXene films. The water contact angle can be readily regulated from 65.7° to 95.7°. This film, with excellent EMI shielding performance and tunable wetting behavior, is highly promising for various applications in aerospace, flexible supercapacitors, and smart electronics.',\n",

The 2D transitional metal carbides/nitrides (MXenes) show great application prospects in the field of supercapacitors due to their superior volumetric capacitance, metallic-like conductivity, tunable surface terminations, and structural advantages. However, like other 2D materials, MXenes suffer from the inevitable problem of nanosheet restacking and aggregation, which reduces the overall active surface sites and blocks the accessibility of the electrolyte ions. The transformation of 2D MXene nanosheets into 3D architectures is proven effective to overcome the restacking problem. The review briefly summarizes the preparation strategies of 3D MXene materials, including template-assisted method, framework-assisted method, chemical assembly method, foaming method, and other methods with the discussion centered on the performances of 3D MXenes in supercapacitors. Finally, an outlook on the current progress and opportunities is given to highlight the increasing popularity of 3D MXenes in supercapacitors.',\n",

Herein, a simple strategy to reinforce the structural stability of LMR materials by constructing heterostructure with Nb-based MXenes (Nb2CTx/Nb4C3Tx) is proposed. A small amount of spinel phase and pseudo-bonding between Nb and O ions as well as extra oxygen vacancies can be induced by the MXenes addition in LMR, effectively inactivating the surface oxygen and suppressing the structure distortion. In addition, MXene can also alleviate the volume change during cycling process and provide additional transport channels for electrons. The ably designed 3 wt.% LMR/Nb2CTx cathode presented high initial Coulombic efficiency of 85.6% at 0.1 C (vs. 77.4% for the pristine material) and excellent cycling performance with a capacity retention of 83.8% after 200 cycles at 0.5 C (vs. 66.6% for the pristine material).

       "  'abstract': 'Two-dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene, graphene oxide, transition metal oxide, MXene and others have shown high potential for the design and fabrication of various sensors and biosensors due to their 2D layered structure and unique properties. Compared to traditional fluorescent, electrochemical, and electrical biosensors, colorimetric biosensors exhibit several advantages including naked-eye determination, low cost, quick response, and easy fabrication. In this review, we present recent advances in the design, fabrication, and applications of 2D material-based high-performance colorimetric biosensors. Potential colorimetric sensing mechanisms and optimal material selection as well as sensor fabrication are introduced in brief. In addition, colorimetric biosensors based on different 2D materials such as graphene, transition metal dichalcogenide/oxide, MXenes, metal–organic frameworks, and metal nanoplates for the sensitive detection of DNA, proteins, viruses, small molecules, metallic ions, and others are presented and discussed in detail. This work will be helpful for readers to understand the knowledge of 2D material modification, nanozymes, and the synthesis of hybrid materials; meanwhile, it could be valuable to promote the design, fabrication, and applications of 2D material-based sensors and biosensors in quick bioanalysis and disease diagnostics.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\n\\nDespite intense development of inkjet printing for scalable and customizable fabrication of power sources, one major shortcoming is the lack of eco-friendly aqueous inks free of additives (e.g., toxic solvents, surfactants). Here, an aqueous printable MXene/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonic acid) (MP) hybrid ink is demonstrated that has an adjustable viscosity to directly inkjet-print micro-supercapacitors (MP-MSCs) with excellent performance, seamless integration, and desirable customization, which is crucial for scalable industrialization of self-powered integrated systems. The MP-MSCs deliver an unprecedented volumetric capacitance of 754\\xa0F\\xa0cm−3 and a remarkable energy density of 9.4\\xa0mWh\\xa0cm−3, superior to previously reported inkjet-printed MSCs. Such outstanding performance is partly attributed to highly conductive PH1000 that prevents restacking of MXene nanosheets, enabling fast electron and ion diffusion throughout the microelectrodes. Moreover, MP-MSCs present exceptional miniaturization and superior modularization featuring high voltage output up to 36\\xa0V from 60 serially connected cells and impressive areal voltage of 5.4\\xa0V\\xa0cm−2 connected in tandem. Further, a printable temperature sensor integrated with the MP-MSC and a flexible solar cell exhibits an exceptional response of 2% and mechanical flexibility without any bias voltage input. Therefore, the MXene inks are expected to create various opportunities for miniaturization and innovative construction of flexible, self-sustaining, energy harvesting–storing–consuming microsystems for printable electronics.',\n",

However, it still remains a great challenge to balance the sensitivity, selectivity, working temperature, and response/recovery speed. In this work, Berlin green (BG) framework is demonstrated as a highly promising sensing material for ammonia detection by both density functional theory simulation and experimental gas sensing investigation. Vacancy in BG framework offers abundant active sites for ammonia absorption, and the absorbed ammonia transfers sufficient electron to BG, arousing remarkable enhancement of resistance. Pristine BG framework shows remarkable response to ammonia at 50–110\\xa0°C with the highest response at 80\\xa0°C, which is jointly influenced by ammonia's absorption onto BG surface and insertion into BG lattice. The sensing performance of BG can hardly be achieved at room temperature due to its high resistance. Introduction of conductive Ti3CN MXene overcomes the high resistance of pure BG framework, and the simply prepared BG/Ti3CN mixture shows high selectivity to ammonia at room temperature with satisfying response/recovery speed.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'As a typical two-dimensional (2D) MXene, Ti3C2O2 has been considered as a potential material for high-performance hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst, due to its anticorrosion and hydrophilic surface. However, it is still a challenge to improve the Ti3C2O2 surficial HER catalytic activity. In this work, we investigated the HER activity of Ti3C2O2 after the surface was doped with S, Se, and Te by the first principles method. The results indicated that the HER activity of Ti3C2O2 is improved after being doped with S, Se, Te because the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption (ΔGH) is increased from −2.19 eV to 0.08 eV. Furthermore, we also found that the ΔGH of Ti3C2O2 increased from 0.182 eV to 0.08 eV with the doping concentration varied from 5.5% to 16.7%. The HER catalytic activity improvement of Ti3C2O2 is attributed to the local crystal structure distortion in catalytic active sites and Fermi level shift leads to the p-d orbital hybridization. Our results pave a new avenue for preparing a low-cost and high performance HER catalyst.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Herein, based on the paramount importance of combating emerging diseases, through employing a detailed in-silico study, the possibility of using MXenes in suppressing the coronavirus infection was elucidated. To this end, first, interactions of MXene nanosheets (Mn2C, Ti2C, and Mo2C) and spike protein (SP), the main infecting portion of the COVID-19, were investigated. It was found that the modeled MXenes were effective in attracting the SP, so that they can be exploited in filtering the coronavirus. In addition, the effect of the MXenes on the SP structure was assessed which demonstrated that the secondary structure of the SP could be changed. Therefore, the post-interactions of the SP/ACE2 (receptor of coronavirus in the body) could be interrupted, declaring the lower chance of coronavirus infecting. The in-silico studies revealed that the MXenes not only can be used to adsorb and hinder the distribution of the coronavirus but also affect the SP structure and the SP/ACE2 interactions to interrupt the COVID-19 threat. Therefore, MXenes can be exploited with simultaneous roles in physical inhibition and reactive weakening of the COVID-19. In this regard, the Mn2C nanosheet was well suited, which is suggested as a promising candidate to combat the coronavirus.',\n",

Ultrathin cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) are employed for assisting in building ultralow-density, robust, and highly flexible transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes) aerogels with oriented biomimetic cell walls. A significant influence of the angles between oriented cell walls and the incident EM wave electric field direction on the EMI shielding performance is revealed, providing an intriguing microstructure design strategy. MXene “bricks” bonded by CNF “mortars” of the nacre-like cell walls induce high mechanical strength, electrical conductivity, and interfacial polarization, yielding the resultant MXene/CNF aerogels an ultrahigh EMI shielding performance.

In this review, we mainly focus on the applications of MXene-based composites for photocatalytic solar fuel production. We will start from summarizing the general synthesis of MXene-based composite photocatalysts. Then the recent progress on MXene-based composite photocatalysts for solar fuel synthesis, including water splitting for H2 production, CO2 reduction to solar fuels, and N2 fixation for NH3 synthesis is elucidated.

Inspired by synergistic/sequential therapeutic modality, herein a novel therapeutic modality is reported based on the construction of two-dimensional (2D) core/shell-structured Nb2C–MSNs–SNO composite nanosheets for photonic thermogaseous therapy. A phototriggered thermogas-generating nanoreactor is designed via mesoporous silica layer coating on the surface of Nb2C MXene nanosheets, where the mesopores provide the reservoirs for NO donor (S-nitrosothiol (RSNO)), and the core of Nb2C produces heat shock upon second near-infrared biowindow (NIR-II) laser irradiation. The Nb2C–MSNs–SNO-enabled photonic thermogaseous therapy undergoes a sequential process of phototriggered heat production from the core of Nb2C and thermotriggered NO generation, together with photoacoustic-imaging (PAI) guidance and monitoring. The constructed Nb2C–MSNs–SNO nanoreactors exhibit high-NIR-induced photothermal effect, intense NIR-controlled NO release, and desirable PAI performance. Based on these unique theranostic properties of Nb2C–MSNs–SNO nanocomposites, sequential photonic thermogaseous therapy with limited systematic toxicity on efficiently suppressing tumor growth is achieved by PAI-guided NIR-controlled NO release as well as heat generation. Such a thermogaseous approach representes a stimuli-selective strategy for synergistic/sequential cancer treatment.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\n\\nFlexible pressure sensors are one of the most important components in the fields of electronic skin (e-skin), robotics, and health monitoring. However, the application of pressure sensors in practice is still difficult and expensive due to the limited sensing properties and complex manufacturing process. The emergence of MXene, a red-hot member of the 2D nanomaterials, has brought a brand-new breakthrough for pressure sensing. Ti3C2Tx is the most popular studied MXene in the field of pressure sensing and shows good mechanical, electrical properties, excellent hydrophilicity, and extensive modifiability. It will ameliorate the properties of the sensitive layer and electrode layer of the pressure sensor, and further apply pressure sensing to many fields, such as e-skin flexibility. Herein, the preparation technologies, antioxidant methods, and properties of MXene are summarized. The design of MXene-based microstructures is introduced, including hydrogels, aerogels, foam, fabrics, and composite nanofibers. The mechanisms of MXene pressure sensors are further broached, including piezoresistive, capacitive, piezoelectric, triboelectric, and potentiometric transduction mechanism. Moreover, the integration of multiple devices is reviewed. Finally, the chance and challenge of pressure sensors improved by MXene smart materials in future e-skin and the Internet of Things are prospected.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'High temperature ammonia treatments were performed on carbon felt electrodes in this study. Their physical and electrochemical properties were investigated.\\n               Carbon felt electrodes are often used in vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs). Without intervention, carbon felt has poor wettability which frustrates electrochemical activity. This material must be modified to make it more effective, which has been historically accomplished with thermal treatments to promote oxygen functional groups. [1] Many attempts have been made to improve performance of carbon felt in VRFBs, but some of the more successful modifications have resulted in an increase in the specific surface area.

The samples were tested in a single-cell flow battery using cyclic voltammetry (CV), polarization curves, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). This treatment results in a significant increase in electrochemical surface area and performance.\\n               The physical properties were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and Raman spectroscopy.

       "  'abstract': 'In this work silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were in situ synthesized on surface of graphene oxide (GO) and Ti3C2TX MXene at room temperature and without any reducing agent. The prepared GO_AgNPs and MX_AgNPs nanomaterials were deposited on electrodes and applied for voltammetric sensing of pesticide metazachlor. The chosen analyte underwent electrochemical reduction readable as faradaic current and identified as the electrochemical reductive dechlorination. It was found that GO_AgNP (electrochemically reduced to ErGO_AgNP before measurements) was more efficient catalyst of the observed dechlorination than MX_AgNP, even though it contained approximately 10-fold lower amount of silver. The smaller size of AgNP achieved with GO was the most probable reason. When the metazachlor sensing properties of the nanohybrid-modified electrodes were investigated, the linear range and the limit of detection of 37–1123 μM and 27 μM, respectively, were observed for ErGO_AgNP while only 37–375 μM and 40 μM for MX_AgNP. The ErGO_AgNP nanohybrid was more convenient also for metazachlor detection in alkali leachate of real soil samples, probably as the result of antifouling effect of ErGO. Although there are conventional instrumental analysis methods for sensing orders of magnitude lower concentrations of metazachlor, in this work it is for the first time shown that the AgNP-based nanohybrid efficiently catalyse the electrochemical dechlorination applicable for detection of this frequently used pesticide.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'AbstractThe shuttle effect caused by soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) deteriorates multiphase transformation reaction kinetics of sulfur species, and gives rise to an unserviceable lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery. Catalysis, as a process optimization approach, offers an option to eliminate the intrinsic issues. However, exploring and understanding the role of catalysts on electrode reaction remains critical bottlenecks, particularly as they are prone to continuous evolution under complex dynamic environment. Herein, platinum nanoparticles loaded on MXene nanosheets, as sulfur host, and the action of catalysts on the reaction process are investigated via ex-situ monitors upon solid–liquid–solid chemical transformation of sulfur species. These traces confirm that the high performance originates from electron transfer between catalysts and LiPSs, which lowers the nucleation barrier from liquid LiPSs to solid Li2S/Li2S2. Further, the accelerated liquid–solid conversion can alleviate the accumulation of LiPSs, and boost the reaction kinetics in Li-S batteries. The findings corroborate the electronic modulation between catalysts and LiPSs, which is a generalizable strategy to optimize energy conversion efficiency of Li-S batteries.Graphical abstractMultiple ex-situ monitors were applied to investigate the role of Pt/Ti2C catalysts in accelerating the conversion of polysulfides at different states during discharge/charge process.Download : Download high-res image (295KB)Download : Download full-size image',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\n\\nTraditional wound dressings mainly participate in the passive healing processes and are rarely engaged in active wound healing by stimulating skin cell behaviors. Electrical stimulation (ES) has been known to regulate skin cell behaviors. Herein, a series of multifunctional hydrogels based on regenerated bacterial cellulose (rBC) and MXene (Ti3C2Tx) are first developed that can electrically modulate cell behaviors for active skin wound healing under external ES. The composite hydrogel with 2 wt% MXene (rBC/MXene-2%) exhibits the highest electrical conductivity and the best biocompatibility. Meanwhile, the rBC/MXene-2% hydrogel presents desired mechanical properties, favorable flexibility, good biodegradability, and high water-uptake capacity. An in vivo study using a rat full-thickness defect model reveals that this rBC/MXene hydrogel exhibits a better therapeutic effect than the commercial Tegaderm film. More importantly, in vitro and in vivo data demonstrate that coupling with ES, the hydrogel can significantly enhance the proliferation activity of NIH3T3 cells and accelerate the wound healing process, as compared to non-ES controls. This study suggests that the biodegradable and electroactive rBC/MXene hydrogel is an appealing candidate as a wound dressing for skin wound healing, while also providing an effective synergistic therapeutic strategy for accelerating wound repair process through coupling ES with the hydrogel dressing.',\n",

By controlling the thickness of the copper diffusion barrier layer, the crystal growth can be controlled between a highly uniform AA-stacked T-phase Mo2C and a “wedding cake” like Mo2C crystal with spatially delineated zone in which the Bernal-stacked Mo2C predominate. The atomic structures, as well as the transformations between distinct stackings, are simulated and analyzed using density functional theory (DFT)-based calculations.

COF-LZU1 microspheres are distributed among the MXene film framework. Lithiophilic COF-LZU1 microspheres as nucleation seeds can promote uniform Li nucleation by homogenizing the Li+ flux and lowering the nucleation barrier, finally resulting in dense and dendrite-free Li deposition. Under the regulation of the COF-LZU1 seeds, the Coulombic efficiency of the MXene/COF-LZU1 framework and electrochemical stability of corresponding symmetric cells are obviously enhanced.

       "  'abstract': \"Abstract\\n\\nMicro-supercapacitors (MSCs), albeit powerful, are unable to broaden their potential applications primarily because they are not as flexible and morphable as electronics. To address this problem, a universal strategy to fabricate substrate-free, ultrathin, shapeless planar-MSCs with high-performance tenability under serious deformation is put forward. These represent a new class of “all-inside-one” film supercapacitors, achieved by encapsulating two-dimensional interdigital microelectrodes within chemically cross-linked polyvinyl-alcohol-based hydrogel electrolyte containing graphene oxide (GO). GO nanosheets significantly improve ionic conductivity, enhance the capacitance, and boost robustness of hydrogel electrolyte. Consequently, the entire MSC, while being only 37 µm thick, can be crumpled and its shape can self-adjust through fluid channel ten times smaller than its original size without any damage, demonstrating shapelessness. Using MXene as active material, high single-cell areal capacitance of 40.8 mF cm−2 is achieved from microelectrodes as thin as 5 µm. Furthermore, to demonstrate wide applicability of this protocol, screen-printed graphene-based highly integrated MSCs connecting nine cells in series are fabricated to stably output a high voltage of 7.2 V while crumpling them from 0.11 to 0.01 cm−3, manifesting superior performance uniformity. This protocol allows the coexistence of high performance with incredible flexibility that may greatly diversify MSCs' applications.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Layer-structured materials have been widely used in various applications due to their distinctive structures and physical/ chemical properties. As the electrode materials for sodium (Na)-ion batteries (NIB), their intercalation mechanisms remain unclear and their electrochemical performances are unsatisfied with low storage capacity and poor cycling stability. Therefore, it is essential to find new layered materials, explore their intercalation mechanisms and improve their electrochemical performance. In these regards, this thesis focuses on four layered materials in terms of atomic structural characterization, phase transition and intercalation mechanism, and improvement of their electrochemical performance, including anti-P2 Na0.5NbO2, Mxene Ti3C2X and transition-metal dichalcogenides MoS2. \\n               Most of the layered AxMO2 (A=alkali ions, M= transition metals) are composed of edge-shared MO6 octahedrons, wherein A ions occupy in the interlayers with varied coordination polyhedron such as octahedrons (O), tetrahedrons (T) or trigonal prisms (P). We synthesized a new layered oxide material anti-P2 Na0.5NbO2 with negative strain effect. Its structure is composed of NbO6 trigonal prisms and NaO6 octahedrons. Analysis by X-ray absorption spectroscopy(XAS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicates that the negative volume change is mainly a result of the enhanced interlayer (Na-O) interaction and the weakened Nb-Nb and Nb-O bonding in the O-Nb-O slab upon Na intercalation. As an anode material for NIB, Na0.5NbO2 exhibits high structural stability, long cycle life and prominent rate performance for NIB. Thanks to its negative stain effect, Na0.5NbO2 can be used as a “volume buffer” for the positive-strain electrode materials to construct long-term batteries with high energy density. \\n               MXenes represent a large family of functionalized two-dimensional (2D) transition-metal carbides and carbonitrides. However, most of the understandings on their unique structures and applications are stopped at the theoretical suggestion. We clarified the surface structure and intercalation chemistry of Ti3C2X at the atomic scale by aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) and DFT calculations. The STEM studies show that the functional groups (e.g. OH-, F-, O-) and the intercalated sodium (Na) ions prefer to stay on the top sites of the centro-Ti atoms and the C atoms of the Ti3C2 monolayer, respectively. Double Na-atomic layers are found within the Ti3C2X interlayer upon extensive Na intercalation via two-phase transition and solid-solution reactions. In addition, aluminum (Al)-ion intercalation leads to horizontal sliding of the Ti3C2X monolayer. Based on these observations, the previous monolayer surface model of Ti3C2X is modified. DFT calculations using the new modeling help to understand more about their physical and chemical properties. Meanwhile, the Ti3C2X exhibits prominent rate performance and long-term cycling stability as an anode material for NIB. \\n               The distinctive electronic and chemical properties of transition-metal dichalcogenides are closely related to their structure and intercalation chemistry. By means of STEM, we clarified the phase transition from semiconductive 2H-MoS2 to metallic 1T-MoS2 and occupancy of the intercalated Na at the atomic scale. It is shown that x = 1.5 in NaxMoS2 is a critical point for the reversibility of the structural evolution. If light of the understanding of the phase transitions and intercalation chemistry of the MoS2, the cycling stability and rate performance of MoS2 are improved by controlling its reaction depth, optimizing the binder and nano-treatment.\\n                 \\n               \\n                  \\n                     \\n                  \\n               \\n               Figure 1',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Two dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene have attracted tremendous interest and have shown promising potential in various applications due to their unique physical structure and properties. Another new class of 2D materials, a group of early transition metal carbides and/or carbonitrides, called MXene, have been studied and reported recently. MXenes are chemically derived from layered Mn+1AXn or MAX phases, where M is early transition metal, A is an A-group element (mainly groups 13 and 14), X is C and/or N, and n=1,2, and 3. Since discovery of the first MXene (Ti3C2) in 2011, more than 10 new MXenes have been synthesized and demonstrated its interesting and unique properties in many applications. It has been shown that MXenes have promising potential in electrochemical energy storage applications such as lithium ion batteries (LIBs) and electrochemical capacitors (ECs), due to their high electrical conductivity, good structural/chemical stability, and large surface areas. \\n               Recently, MXene application studies are expanding to other battery systems such as Na-ion batteries (NIBs). The growing concerns on the cost and resource limit of lithium for large scale applications have triggered the development of NIBs as an alternative battery system to LIBs for large scale energy storage applications due to their potentially low-cost and natural abundance. Moreover, the accumulated knowledge and technology of LIBs enables fast-advancements of NIBs research since the operating principles of the NIBs are similar to that of “rocking-chair” mechanism in LIBs. Although many concepts can be adopted from LIB in NIB research, the electrochemistry of NIBs turns out to be different in many aspects requiring new design of electrode materials and electrolyte for improving and/or optimizing performance of NIBs. In particular, Na+ has a larger radius than Li+, which directly affects the mass transport and storage in the electrochemical reaction. This makes many of current LIB anode materials, such as graphite, unsuitable for NIBs. In this regards, the laminar nature of MXenes bonded by weak van der walls forces and its inherent interlayer spacing are very attractive as anode materials for NIBs. However, most of studies on the electrochemical behavior of MXenes as anode materials for NIBs are just at the theoretical estimation only without much experimental support. \\n               In this study, we present a systematic study on the electrochemical properties and their charge storage mechanisms of V2C and Nb2C MXenes as anode materials for NIBs. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) were used in both ex situ and in situ way to look at the structural changes during electrochemical cycling. By utilizing such combined X-ray techniques, we are able to get better understanding of structural/electronic structure changes of MXenes and their related charge storage behavior during sodiation/desodiation process. A systematic comparison of electrochemical properties and charge storage mechanism for MXenes between NIBs and LIBs as well as the approaches to improve them will also be discussed. \\n               Acknowledgement \\n               The work done at Brookhaven National Lab was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, the Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Office of Vehicle Technologies, under Contract Number DE-SC0012704.

If n = 2 the MXene layer consists of 2 octahedra blocks; if n = 3, consists of 3 blocks of octahedra. The surface of as-synthesized MXenes is terminated by a mixture of moieties viz. O, OH, and F (this mixture is referred hence after by Tx). To date, the following MXenes were successfully synthesized: Ti2CTx, Nb2CTx, V2CTx, (Ti0.5,Nb0.5)2CTx, Ti3C2Tx, (V0.5,Cr0.5)3C2Tx, Ti3CNTx, Ta4C3Tx, and Nb4C3Tx. \\n               Unlike conventional 3D transition metal carbides and nitrides which are known to be inert for Li, MXenes were found to be electrochemically active as host materials for Li-ions. The latter intercalate/de-intercalate reversibly between the MXenes layers during the electrochemical cycling in Li batteries. This was confirmed by in situ XRD studies during electrochemical lithiation and de-lithiation. When they were tested as electrode materials for Li-ion batteries (LIBs), each MXene showed its own electrochemical voltage window. In principle, some MXenes could function as cathodes and some as anodes for LIBs. MXenes electrodes exhibited an excellent capability to handle high cycling rates with good capacity. This was explained by a low Li diffusion barrier in case of MXene compared to other electrode materials such as graphite. MXenes powders can be cold pressed into freestanding thick discs resulting in electrodes with high areal capacities exceeding 5 mAh/cm2. Most of the research conducted –experimentally- on MXenes as electrodes for LIBs was limited to the as-synthesized MXene without further control of the surface termination. However, ab initio calculations predict that controlling the surface termination could enhance the performance. Herein the progress in the synthesis of MXenes and controlling their surface termination, in addition to their performance as electrode materials in LIBs will be discussed.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Due to their unique properties and a great diversity, various two-dimensional nanomaterials have attracted interest from scientific community for energy storage applications in recent years. Herein, we present a facile strategy to prepare MXene/graphene films with excellent flexibility and electrical conductivity for supercapacitors by using layer-by-layer electrostatic self-assembly from solution between positively charged graphene and negatively charged MXene nanosheets. Graphene nanosheets are intercalated in-between MXene layers after electrostatic assembly. As a result, the face-to-face self-restacking of MXene nanosheets is effectively prevented, leading to the considerably increased interlayer spacing of MXene layers and more active sites accessible to electrolyte ions, which ensures high diffusion rate and transport of electrolyte ions during the charge/discharge process. The as-prepared freestanding MXene/graphene (5wt.%) film displays outstanding volumetric capacitance of 1040 F cm-3 at a scan rate of 2 mV s-1 and impressive rate capability with 61% capacitance retention at 1000 mV s-1. Meanwhile, the film electrode exhibits a long cycle life with almost no capacitance decay after 20,000 cycles. More importantly, our fabricated symmetric supercapacitor shows a maximum volumetric energy density of 34.6 Wh L-1 and an ultrahigh volumetric power density up to 74.4 kW L-1, which is among the highest values reported for carbon and MXene based materials in aqueous electrolytes so far. This work not only provides fundamental insights to the effect of interlayer spacing on the electrochemical performance of emerging MXene materials but also sheds light on future design of next-generation flexible, portable and highly integrated supercapacitors with high volumetric and rate performances.\\n                 \\n               \\n                  \\n                     \\n                  \\n               \\n               Figure 1',\n",

Very recently, a new family of 2D materials called MXenes were synthesized and have been considered as one of the most promising pseudocapacitor electrode materials with respect to both power density and energy density. In this work, we employ first-principles calculations to study the electronic structures and redox potential and diffusion of Li on Ti2C monolayer, a representative MXene, based on density functional theory (DFT). The electronic structures indicate a significant redox pseudocapacitance characteristics as an anode with the redox potential at about 0.25 V and 0.75 V refer to the standard hydrogen electrode. Moreover, the calculated metallic behavior and low Li ions diffusion barriers suggest that Ti2C monolayer would manifest a low resistance in charging/discharging process.

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\n\\nCommercially available supercapacitors offer very limited advantages over other energy storage devices. Balancing their electrochemical performance such as capacitance, energy density, and cyclability is challenging. Studies have shown that this challenge can be overcome by using light and cheap substrates that are highly stable with solvents, and have high loading capacities and compatibility with nanomaterials. Nanocellulose, derived from wastes or biomass, is a good candidate for integrating with other nanosize conductive materials, such as carbon, conducting polymers, and metal oxides, as active materials or nanocomposites for supercapacitors. This review focuses on the properties and preparation of nanocellulose sourced from wastes (biomass) and bacteria, and extends to emerging materials, such as metal–organic frameworks and MXene, for nanocellulose-based supercapacitors. Even though supercapacitors are mainly composed of electrodes, electrolytes, and separators, this paper focuses on the overall electrochemical performance of nanocellulose-based supercapacitors to evaluate the influence of nanocellulose. In addition, the potentials and possible limitations of nanocellulose in supercapacitors are discussed. Overall, the incorporation of waste-derived nanocellulose into energy storage applications is an initiative that improves the circular economy and supports environmental sustainability.',\n",

We discovered the significant decrease in the amount of functional groups (-F and -Cl) and increase in the -O content, which refers to the oxidation of the material. Also we determined the optimal regime for Raman spectroscopy in order to avoid any changes in the structure of the material. We revealed that titanium carbide changes its structure at 700 °C and 900 °C into two different titanium dioxide modifications like rutile and anatase in Ar (with 0.01% O2) atmosphere. Also there are small changes occurred in Ti3C2Tx structure and formation of amorphous carbon after 700 °C treatment in H2 (with 0.01% H2O) atmosphere and formation of TiO2 (rutile) at 900 °C. Energydispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) revealed the reduction of functional groups at 700 °C in both atmospheres and total disappearance of –F and –Cl and increasing the oxygen at 900 °C. The huge increase of oxygen by atomic percent, can be explained by the initial oxygen content in argon and hydrogen gases.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Enclosed you will find the article entitled “A study of two-dimensional single atom-supported MXenes as hydrogen evolution reaction catalysts using DFT and machine learning”. Existing studies predominantly focused on the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activities and stabilities of oxygen-terminated MXenes with single-atom loading. However, to the best of our knowledge, two-dimensional (2D) MXenes with different terminations (e.g. Br, I, Se, Te, B, Si, P, and NH) have not yet been investigated for the purposes of HER catalysis. Therefore, in this work, we considered the combined effect of the different surface terminations (B, NH, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Se, Br, Te, and I) and single atom loading (Ti, V, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zr, Nb, Mo, Tc, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Hf, Ta, W, Re, Os, Ir, Pt, and Au) using DFT calculation. Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption (reflecting activity) and the cohesive energy (a proxy for thermal stability) of these structures (264 in total) were calculated. We demonstrate that 21 uninvestigated 2D single-atom MXene catalysts, among 264 promising candidates, show an electrocatalytic activity surpassing that of platinum and a thermal stability surpassing those of synthesized borophene sheet and MoS2. Moreover, all catalysts examined in this work were further randomly separated into training and test sets with a ratio of 7:3. The HER electrocatalytic performance and thermal stability of the catalysts in the test set were predicted by machine learning algorithms. Most importantly, we present a way to provide a comparable precision (root mean square error values for the activity and thermal stability predictions are 0.158 eV and 0.02 eV, respectively) to the published machine learning works by avoiding their adoption of complex electronic features and the associated high computational cost, and by only using features that are easily available in chemical repositories. The algorithms used in this work are expected to help future researchers quickly screen single atom loaded MXenes HER catalysts at the initial design stage in a cost-effective manner. We have no financial interest in the subject or instrumentation used and there is no known conflict of interest.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\n\\nFiber-shaped supercapacitors (FSCs) are promising energy storage solutions for powering miniaturized or wearable electronics. However, the scalable fabrication of fiber electrodes with high electrical conductivity and excellent energy storage performance for use in FSCs remains a challenge. Here, an easily scalable one-step wet-spinning approach is reported to fabricate highly conductive fibers using hybrid formulations of Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate. This approach produces fibers with a record conductivity of ≈1489 S cm−1, which is about five times higher than other reported Ti3C2Tx MXene-based fibers (up to ≈290 S cm−1). The hybrid fiber at ≈70 wt% MXene shows a high volumetric capacitance (≈614.5 F cm−3 at 5 mV s−1) and an excellent rate performance (≈375.2 F cm−3 at 1000 mV s−1). When assembled into a free-standing FSC, the energy and power densities of the device reach ≈7.13 Wh cm−3 and ≈8249 mW cm−3, respectively. The excellent strength and flexibility of the hybrid fibers allow them to be wrapped on a silicone elastomer fiber to achieve an elastic FSC with 96% capacitance retention when cyclically stretched to 100% strain. This work demonstrates the potential of MXene-based fiber electrodes and their scalable production for fiber-based energy storage applications.',\n",

Although QCM sensors have been widely adopted for moisture sensing, the vast majority of such sensors are limited to laboratory tests due to the lack of portability. This work employed a low-cost Arduino microcontroller board and the Pierce oscillator to track the resonance frequency of the QCM sensor, which made the sensing system highly compact and portable. The efficacy of the sensing platform was validated by humidity sensing measurements. Graphene oxide (GO), MXene, and their composite (MXene/GO) were coated on the surface of three QCM sensors to provide oxygen-containing functional groups for interaction with water molecules. The humidity sensing properties of the three sensors were evaluated and compared over the RH range of 0% to 84%. All three sensors showed decent humidity sensing performance in terms of sensitivity, response/recovery time, hysteresis, and accuracy. The QCM-GO sensor exhibited the highest RH sensitivity of 38.5 Hz/%RH, shortest response/recovery time of 15 s/9 s, and lowest hysteresis, while the QCM-MXene/GO sensor revealed the lowest frequency drift of less than 0.7% in a constant RH environment over 30 minutes.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Two-dimensional (2D) materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), black phosphorus (BP), MXene and borophene, have aroused extensive attention since the discovery of graphene in 2004. They have wide range of applications in many research fields, such as optoelectronic devices, energy storage, catalysis, owing to their striking physical and chemical properties. Among them, anisotropic 2D material is one kind of 2D materials that possess different properties along different directions caused by the intrinsic anisotropic atoms’ arrangement of the 2D materials, mainly including BP, borophene, low-symmetry TMDs (ReSe2 and ReS2) and group IV monochalcogenides (SnS, SnSe, GeS, and GeSe). Recently, a series of new devices has been fabricated based on these anisotropic 2D materials. In this review, we start from a brief introduction of the classifications, crystal structures, preparation techniques, stability, as well as the strategy to discriminate the anisotropic characteristics of 2D materials. Then, the recent advanced applications including electronic devices, optoelectronic devices, thermoelectric devices and nanomechanical devices based on the anisotropic 2D materials both in experiment and theory have been summarized. Finally, the current challenges and prospects in device designs, integration, mechanical analysis, and micro-/nano-fabrication techniques related to anisotropic 2D materials have been discussed. This review is aimed to give a generalized knowledge of anisotropic 2D materials and their current devices applications, and thus inspiring the exploration and development of other kinds of new anisotropic 2D materials and various novel device applications.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Dual-filler MMMs have attracted special interests in recent years because of the possibility of producing synergetic effect. This study is aimed at exploring the underlying synergy between 2D nanosheets and a non-2D filler in mixed matrix membranes for gas separation. MXene or GO as typical nanosheet filler is selected to be in pair with a non-2D filler, SiO2 or HNTs, with Pebax as the polymer matrix. In this way, four pairs of binary fillers are designed and the corresponding four groups of MMMs are fabricated. By tuning the mass ratio of binary fillers, synergetic effect is found for each group of MMMs. However, the two 2D fillers found different preferential non-2D partners. GO works better with HNTs than SiO2, while MXene prefers SiO2 to HNTs. To be noted, GO/HNTs renders the membranes the maximum enhancement of CO2 permeability (153%) and CO2/N2 selectivity (72%) compared to Pebax control membrane, while each of them as single filler only brought about very limited enhancement of CO2 separation performance. The possible mechanisms are thoroughly discussed in terms of filler dispersion, nanosheet flexibility, and the tortuosity and connectivity of the surface diffusion pathways along nanosheets.',\n",

Although current nonaqueous EES devices operate through the intercalation chemistry of host electrode materials, capacitive or pseudocapacitive intercalation has recently emerged as an alternative chemistry for advanced aqueous EES devices. In particular, metal carbide/nitride nanosheets termed MXene are a promising class of intercalation capacitor and pseudocapacitor electrode materials. However, general design strategies of MXenes for aqueous EES applications have not been established because of the limited understanding of the complex electrochemical properties of MXenes with aqueous electrolytes. In this talk, using experimental and theoretical analyses, we clarify the anomalous dielectric properties of aqueous ions confined between MXene nanosheets, leading to the enhanced charge storage capability of MXenes with aqueous electrolytes.

These results provide an insight into the understanding of the method of efficiently increasing the energy storage performance, which will be useful for designing and using high performance electrode materials.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'AbstractLow-temperature assembly of MXene nanosheets into three-dimensional (3D) robust aerogels addresses the crucial stability concern of the nano-building blocks during the fabrication process, which is of key importance for transforming the fascinating properties at the nanoscale into the macroscopic scale for practical applications. Herein, suitable cross-linking agents (amino-propyltriethoxysilane, Mn2+, Fe2+, Zn2+, and Co2+) as interfacial mediators to engineer the interlayer interactions are reported to realize the graphene oxide (GO)-assisted assembly of Ti3C2Tx MXene aerogel at room temperature. This elaborate aerogel construction not only suppresses the oxidation degradation of Ti3C2Tx but also generates porous aerogels with a high Ti3C2Tx content (87 wt%) and robustness, thereby guaranteeing the functional accessibility of Ti3C2Tx nanosheets and operational reliability as integrated functional materials. In combination with a further sulfur modification, the Ti3C2Tx aerogel electrode shows promising electrochemical performances as the freestanding anode for sodium-ion storage. Even at an ultrahigh loading mass of 12.3\\xa0mg\\xa0cm−2, a pronounced areal capacity of 1.26 mAh cm−2 at a current density of 0.1 A g−1 has been achieved, which is of practical significance. This work conceptually suggests a new way to exert the utmost surface functionalities of MXenes in 3D monolithic form and can be an inspiring scaffold to promote the application of MXenes in different areas.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\n\\nIn 2017, a new family of in-plane, chemically-ordered quaternary MAX phases, coined i-MAX, has been reported since 2017. The first i-MAX phase, (Mo2/3Sc1/3)2AlC, garnered significant research attention due to the presence of chemically ordered Sc within the Mo-dominated M layer, and the facilitated removal of both Al and Sc upon etching, resulting in 2D i-MXene, Mo1.33C, with ordered divacancies. The i-MXene renders an exceptionally low resistivity of 33.2 µΩ m−1 and a high volumetric capacitance of ≈1150 F cm−3. This discovery has been followed by the synthesis of, to date, 32 i-MAX phases and 5 i-MXenes, where the latter have shown potential for applications including, but not limited to, energy storage and catalysis. Herein, fundamental investigations of i-MAX phases and i-MXenes, along with their applicability in supercapacitive and catalytic applications, are reviewed. Moreover, recent results on ion intercalation and post-etching treatment of Mo1.33C are presented. The charge storage performance can also be tuned by forming MXene hydrogel and through inert atmosphere annealing, where the latter renders a superior volumetric capacitance of ≈1635 F cm−3. This report demonstrates the potential of the i-MXene family for catalytic and energy storage applications, and highlights novel research directions for further development and successful employment in practical applications.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\n               Grafting of bone-substitute biomaterials plays a vital role in the reconstruction of bone defects. However, the design of bioscaffolds with osteoinductive agents and biomimetic structures for regeneration of critical-sized bone defects is difficult. Ti3C2 MXene—belonging to a new class of 2D nanomaterials—exhibits excellent biocompatibility, and antibacterial properties, and promotes osteogenesis. However, its application in preparing 3D-printed tissue-engineered bone scaffolds for repairing bone defects has not been explored. In this work, Ti3C2 MXene was incorporated into composite scaffolds composed of hydroxyapatite and sodium alginate via extrusion-based 3D printing to evaluate its potential in bone regeneration. MXene composite scaffolds were fabricated and characterized by SEM, XPS, mechanical properties and porosity. The biocompatibility and osteoinductivity of MXene composite scaffolds were evaluated by cell adhesion, cell counting kit-8 test, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, alkaline phosphatase activity and alizarin red S tests of bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). A rat calvarial defect model was performed to explore the osteogenic activity of the MXene composite scaffolds in vivo. The results showed the obtained scaffold had a uniform structure, macropore morphology, and high mechanical strength. In vitro experimental results revealed that the scaffold exhibited excellent biocompatibility with BMSCs, promoted cell proliferation, upregulated osteogenic gene expression, enhanced alkaline phosphatase activity, and promoted mineralized-nodule formation. The experimental results confirmed that the scaffold effectively promoted bone regeneration in a model of critical-sized calvarial- bone-defect in vivo and promoted bone healing to a significantly greater degree than scaffolds without added Ti3C2 MXene did. Conclusively, the Ti3C2 MXene composite 3D-printed scaffolds are promising for clinical bone defect treatment, and the results of this study provide a theoretical basis for the development of practical applications for tissue-engineered bone scaffolds.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\n\\nThe wide-spread proliferation of aqueous MXene-based supercapacitor has been largely shadowed by the limited cell potential window (typically in the range of 0–0.6 V). To address this baffling issue, designing asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) is proposed as a rational strategy to enlarge the potential window (thus energy density) of individual cell in aqueous electrolytes. To this date, however, it still remains a great challenge to develop easy fabricating, 3D nanostructured, and pseudocapacitive cathode materials that can perfectly match with MXene anode materials. In this work, we propose a supramolecular strategy to construct conducting polymer hydrogel (CPH) with highly interconnected 3D nanostructures and large pseudocapacitance, which can finely match with 2D Ti3C2Tx. The as-assembled CPH//Ti3C2Tx ASC with CPH cathode and MXene anode can operate in a broadened potential window of 1.15 V in aqueous PVA/H2SO4 gel electrolyte with remarkably improved energy density of 16.6 μWh/cm2 (nine times higher than that of symmetric MXene supercapacitor). Additionally, this ASC exhibits outstanding cyclic stability with no trackable performance decay over 30,000 galvanostatic charge and discharge cycles. It is demonstrated in this work that employing positive CPH electrode is a feasible yet promising strategy to enhance the potential window and energy density of aqueous MXene supercapacitors.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'MnO2 shows fast redox behavior (Mn(Ⅲ)/Mn(Ⅳ)) and has a large overpotential for oxygen evolution reaction, hence has been used as an active material for aqueous electrochemical capacitors. MnO2 electrodes generally consists of MnO2 powder, conductive carbon and polymeric binders. However, conductivity additives and polymer binders are electrochemically non-active or poorly active for energy storage. The reduction in the amount of such additives and polymeric binder will lead to the improvement in the energy and power density. Conductive nanosheets such as MXene has been recently studied as an active binder, acting as a redox active conductive additive.1 Unfortunately, MXene has poor stability in aqueous electrolyte at high potentials due to irreversible oxidation and is not sufficient for use with MnO2 positive electrodes.2 In this work, RuO2 nanosheets with high electronic conductivity and specific capacitance is studied as an active and stable binder. 3\\n               \\n               RuO2 nanosheets4 and MnO2 particles5 were synthesized according to literature. The MnO2-RuO2 nanosheet composite electrodes (MnO2(100-x)-RuO2(x); x=100, 80, 60, 50, 30, 20, 10, 0, x indicates the molar ratio of RuO2 ) were prepared by dropping dispersions of composite ink on a mirror-polished glassy carbon electrode. Electrochemical characterization was conducted by cyclic voltammetry using a three-electrode cell consisting of Pt mesh as a counter electrode and a Ag/AgCl (KCl sat.) reference electrode. 1.0 M Li2SO4 (25°C) was used as the electrolyte.\\n               The morphologies of MnO2(50)-RuO2(50) and MnO2(80)-RuO2(20) were analyzed by SEM-EDX. The SEM images show the presence both of particles and nanosheets. The EDX mappings show a homogeneous distribution of ruthenium atoms, and the distribution of manganese atoms agrees with the location of the particles. Figure 1 show the specific capacitance of MnO2(100-x)-RuO2(x) as a function of RuO2 nanosheet additive at scan rates of 2 and 50 mV s-1. The specific capacitance of the MnO2 particle and the RuO2 nanosheet at 2 mV s-1 were 144 and 233 F (g-material)-1, respectively. By adding 20 mol% RuO2 nanosheet to the MnO2 particle, the specific capacitance increased 188 F (g-material)-1, which was 1.3 times higher than pure MnO2 particle. While the specific capacitance of MnO2 was 23 F (g-material)-1 at 50 mV s-1, by adding 20 mol% RuO2 nanosheet, the specific capacitance increased to 155 F (g-material)-1. This is ~6.5 times higher than pure MnO2. It should be noted that the specific capacitance of MnO2 can easily be improved by adding only 20 mol% RuO2 nanosheets. To clarify the reason of the improved specific capacitance, the specific capacitances per mass of MnO2 or RuO2 were calculated. Based on the results, it is concluded that RuO2 nanosheet acts as a conductive additive for MnO2 while MnO2 acts as a spacer to suppress re-stacking of RuO2 nanosheets, thereby affording high utilization of both MnO2 and RuO2 nanosheets.\\n               This work was supported in part by a JST program on Open Innovation Platform with Enterprise Institute and Academia (OPERA JPMJOP 1843) and ISHIFUKU Metal Industry Co.

       "  'abstract': 'The Internet of Things (IoT) promises users a wider gamut of features and enhanced ease-of-use for devices in both professional and domestic settings. For such devices to have a future however, they will require compact energy storage, especially considering the widespread abandonment of cables in electronic devices for both power and data transfer. One possible answer to this requirement are micro-supercapacitors (MSCs), specifically those based on the MXene Ti3C2Tx, which has been well established as a material for supercapacitors owing to its high capacitance, cycling stability and conductivity.1 Specifically, the creation of Ti3C2Tx supercapacitors via printing techniques such that energy storage can be directly incorporated into the structure of electronics is very appealing and an area of much recent study.2,3 A plurality of these printing techniques have produced planar supercapacitors consisting of a dense MXene film which, while highly conductive, has a limited surface area for intercalation and ion transport.4 These planar devices also have intrinsically inferior space efficiency in real-world electronics. To address this issue, very recent studies have demonstrated 3D printing of nanomaterial-based supercapacitors, however these have been achieved using composites5 or post-processing steps such as freeze-drying.6 In this work, we show that aerosol-jet printing (AJP) of aqueous Ti3C2Tx inks can be used to directly fabricate high aspect ratio 3D structures up to 1 mm in height and with feature sizes as small as 20 µm. These can be realised without the aid of any supporting structures and in a wide range of geometries such as walls, pillars and pyramids. No post-processing is necessary, as only aqueous dispersions are used, without the need for additives, binders or additional drying steps. When such 3D features are integrated into symmetric interdigitated MSCs with gel electrolyte, the 3D structured electrodes exhibit 29% higher areal capacitance than comparable, mass-equivalent planar electrodes, up to 33 mF/cm2 at 10 mV/s.\\n               Figure 1 shows the comparison between 2D (top row) and 3D (bottom row) Ti3C2Tx MSCs of equivalent mass. Cyclic voltammograms show a 29% increase in areal capacitance for the 3D device, 33 mF/cm2 at 10 mV/s. The difference in geometry between the two devices is evident in the low and high magnification SEM images, of particular note are the uniform 3D Ti3C2Tx pillars with height and diameter of approximately 300 µm and 20 µm, respectively.\\n               References:\\n               [1] B.

Energy-intensive bulk water heating has been usually employed to maintain a desired temperature for the BESs. This study concerns a proof-of-concept of a light-to-heat photothermal electrode for solar heating of a local electroactive biofilm in a BES for efficient microbial energy harvesting at low temperatures as a replacement for bulk water heating approaches. The photothermal electrode was prepared by coating Ti3C2Tx MXene sunlight absorber onto carbon felt. The as-prepared photothermal electrode could efficiently raise the local temperature of the bioelectrode to approximately 30\\u2009°C from low bulk water temperatures (i.e., 10, 15, and 20\\u2009°C) under simulated sunlight illumination. As a result, highly efficient microbial energy could be harvested from the low-temperature BES equipped with a photothermal electrode without bulk water heating. This study represents a new avenue for the design and fabrication of electrodes for temperature-sensitive electrochemical and biological systems.',\n",

The MXene/N-rGO was synthesized via a facile one-step hydrothermal method, where ethylenediamine acted as a reducing agent and N source. The doped N in rGO served as a bridge between MXene and rGO through tight hydrogen bonds. Scanning electron microscopy showed that large numbers of MXenes with accordion-like morphology were distributed on the surface of the N-rGO. The MXene/N-rGO composite displayed a synergetic catalytic effect for oxidizing AD, originating from the unique catalytic activity of N-rGO and the large surface area and satisfactory conductivity of MXene. These characteristics of composite material led to a remarkable effect on signal amplification for the detection of AD, with a wide linear range from 10.0 nM to 90.0 μM and a low detection limit of 3.0 nM based on a signal to noise ratio of 3. Moreover, the MXene/N-rGO electrode displayed good stability, repeatability, and reproducibility. Additionally, the proposed sensor was successfully applied for voltammetric sensing of AD in urine with recoveries from 97.75% to 103.0%.',\n",

Besides, efficient and low-cost sensors are also required for future social development. In this paper, it is developed a detector with two-dimensional (2D) material of Ti3C2Tx MXene sensing material by a chemical etchant for ammonia sensing, which shows high response and excellent selectivity to ammonia (NH3) at room temperature of operating temperature. A key point of this work is the thermal treatment temperature of the sensing ceramic tube at 280 °C, which removes the adsorbed water and partially oxidized the material. In ambient condition, Ti3C2Tx MXene-280 shows the response to 500 ppm NH3 with 147\\u2009%, and the counterpart response and recovery time are 67 and 157\\xa0s at room temperature of operating temperature, respectively. In the environment of different relative humidity, its sensing performance is maintained at around 50\\u2009% of the initial performance, which shows great moisture resistance. The higher response and good selectivity of Ti3C2Tx MXene-280 sensor to NH3 at room temperature are ascribed to the powerful hydrogen bond formed between the OH−, O2−\\xa0functional groups on Ti3C2Tx MXene-280 and NH3, as well as the synergistic effect of TiO2 and Ti3C2Tx MXene, generated after heating treatment, which increases the electron transport efficiency. The results demonstrated that the facilely designed Ti3C2Tx MXene-280 sensor is believed to contribute to developing future portable and selective sensing electronics at room temperature.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The leap in communication technology in recent years has brought new challenges to the compactness, modulation speed, working bandwidth and control efficiency of modulation equipment. The discovery of graphene has led the two-dimensional materials to develop rapidly, and a series of new materials have continuously emerged, such as MXene, black phosphorus, transition metal sulfides, etc. These new two-dimensional materials have excellent nonlinear optical effects, strong light-matter interaction, and ultra-wide working bandwidth. Using their thermo-optic effect, nonlinear effect and the combination with optical structure, the needs of ultra-fast modulation in optical communication can be met. Compact, ultra-fast, and ultra-wide will become the tags for all-optical modulation of two-dimensional materials in the future. This article focuses on all-optical devices based on thermo-optical effects and non-linear effects of two-dimensional materials, and introduces fiber-type Mach-Zehnder interferometer structures, Michelson interferometer structures, polarization interferometer structures, and micro-ring structures. In this paper, the development status of all-optical devices is discussed from the perspectives of response time, loss, driving energy, extinction ratio, and modulation depth. Finally, we review the latest developments, analyze the challenges and opportunities faced by all-optical devices, and propose that all-optical devices should be developed in the direction of ring resonators and finding better new two-dimensional materials. We believe that all-optical devices will maintain high-speed development, acting as a cornerstone to promote the progress of all-optical systems.',\n",

Synthesis of MXene (Ti3C2) flakes was conducted using wet chemistry etching method (lithium fluoride & HCL). Amphiphilic structure of poly (ethylene) glycol allows the dispersion of water and MXene nanoflakes appropriately. The studied nanofluids were prepared with mixing of 70 % of PEG with molecular weight of 400 and 30% of deionized (DI) water. The prepared aqueous PEG was mixed with Ti3C2 nanoflakes with two different loading concentrations of 0.05 and 0.1 wt.%. Thermal conductivity measurements of the prepared PEG/Water/MXene nanofluids were conducted using a Tempos thermal properties analyzer (METER group). KS-3 sensor was utilized for thermal conductivity measurements. Enhancements of thermal conductivity of the PEG/Water/MXene nanofluids (0.1 wt.%) were found ∼23-29% over aqueous PEG with the rising temperature from 25 to 45 °C. The high thermal conductivity values proved that this promising heat transfer fluid is dependent on temperature and loading concentrations of MXene nanoflakes in terms of thermal conduction performance. This high thermal conductivity might be due to the presence of extremely large basal plane of MXene sheets in aqueous PEG which can conduct heat through the MXene nanoflake’s basal plane. The viscosity of this nanofluid was measured using Rheometer Anton Paar (MCR92). Shear rate measurement as a function of temperature was conducted for all samples in three different individual temperatures (25, 50 and 85 °C). T-Ramp measurements were conducted within the rising temperature ranges from 25 to 85 °C. The promising results proved that aqueous PEG/Water/MXene nanofluids behave as Newtonian fluid. This finding is perceived for all three different investigated temperatures as well. It was observed that viscosity was decreased at elevated temperatures. The acquired viscosity values for aqueous PEG at the temperatures of 25, 50 and 85 °C were ∼35, ∼16 and ∼5\\u2005mPa.S respectively, which shows ∼85% decrease at temperature of 85 °C, over temperature of 25 °C.

       "  'abstract': 'Efficient approaches for toxic metal removal from wastewater have had transformative impacts to mitigating freshwater scarcity. Adsorption is among the most promising purification techniques due to its simplicity, low cost, and high removal efficiency at ambient conditions. MXene-based nanoarchitectures emerged as promising adsorbents in a plethora of toxic metal removal applications. This was due to the unique hydrophilicity, high surface area, activated metallic hydroxide sites, electron-richness, and massive adsorption capacity of MXene. Given the continual progress in the rational design of MXene nanostructures for water treatment, timely updates on this field are required that deeply emphasize toxic metal removal, including fabrication routes and characterization strategies of the merits, advantages, and limitations of MXenes for the adsorption of toxic metals (i.e., Pb, Cu, Zn, and Cr). This is in addition to the fundamentals and the adsorption mechanism tailored by the shape and composition of MXene based on some representative paradigms. Finally, the limitations of MXenes and their potential future research perspectives for wastewater treatment are also discussed. This review may trigger scientists to develop novel MXene-based nanoarchitectures with well-defined shapes, compositions, and physiochemical merits for efficient, practical removal of toxic metals from wastewater.',\n",

Herein, TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) are in-situ grown on highly conductive Ti3C2 nanosheets via low-temperature hydrothermal strategy, and then black phosphorus quantum dots (BPQDs) are introduced on the surface of TiO2 NPs. Under hydrothermal temperature 120 °C, the BPQDs/Ti3C2@TiO2 photocatalyst exhibits remarkable enhanced photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange (MO) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) compared with BPQDs/Ti3C2 and Ti3C2@TiO2 composites. Enhanced photocatalytic activity can be attributed to (i) the BPQDs with tunable bandgaps are deposited on the TiO2 NPs to form intimate heterojunction, which facilitates the electrons transfer from the conduction band (CB) of BPQDs to the CB of TiO2; (ii) the electrons quickly migrate from CB of TiO2 NPs to the Ti3C2 nanosheets with excellent electronic conductivity via electron transfer channel, which is beneficial to prolong the lifetime of electrons and hinder the recombination of photogenerated carriers; (iii) the enhanced visible light absorption and enlarged specific surface area of BPQDs/Ti3C2@TiO2 further accelerate the photocatalytic reaction.

In this contribution, two-dimensional material, Ti3C2Tx MXene, was introduced into a hyperbranched polyborosilazane. After pyrolyzation, the as-prepared TiC/SiBCN ceramics present excellent EM wave absorption in X-band. The TiC nanograins appearing after annealing provide multilevel reflection and interface polarization. Dipole polarization formed at interface defects, in company with interfacial polarization, also makes a great contribution to enhanced EM wave absorption. The TiC/SiBCN nanocomplex prepared with 5\\xa0wt% Ti3C2Tx MXene possesses a minimum reflection coefficient of −45.44\\xa0dB at 10.93\\xa0GHz and abroad bandwidth 8.4 and 12.4\\xa0GHz, almost covering the entire X-band. Tuning the thickness in the range of 2.35-2.54\\xa0mm, the effective absorption band can achieve the entire X-band. And the EM wave absorbing performance has been maintained to a large extent at 600°C with the minimum reflection coefficient of −26.12\\xa0dB at 12.13\\xa0GHz and the effective absorption bandwidth of 2\\xa0GHz. Last but not the least, TiC/SiBCN ceramics offer a good thermal stability in argon as well as in air atmosphere, making it possible to serve in high-temperature detrimental environments. This study is expected to provide a new perspective for the design of high-performance absorbing materials that are able to be used in harsh environments, especially in high temperatures.',\n",

However, using current methods to produce these yarns, achieving high loadings of electroactive materials and simultaneously demonstrating stretchability is a critical challenge. Here, a one-step bath electrospinning technique is developed to effectively capture Ti3C2Tx MXene flakes throughout continuous nylon and polyurethane (PU) nanofiber yarns (nanoyarns). With up to ≈90 wt% MXene loading, the resulting MXene/nylon nanoyarns demonstrate high electrical conductivity (up to 1195 S cm−1). By varying the flake size and MXene concentration, nanoyarns achieve stretchability of up to 43% (MXene/nylon) and 263% (MXene/PU). MXene/nylon nanoyarn electrodes offer high specific capacitance in saturated LiClO4 electrolyte (440 F cm−3 at 5 mV s−1), with a wide voltage window of 1.25 V and high rate capability (72% between 5 and 500 mV s−1). As strain sensors, MXene/PU yarns demonstrate a wide sensing range (60% under cyclic stretching), high sensitivity (gauge factor of ≈17 in the range of 20–50% strain), and low drift. Utilizing the stretchability of polymer nanofibers and the electrical and electrochemical properties of MXene, MXene-based nanoyarns demonstrate potential in a wide range of applications, including stretchable electronics and body movement monitoring.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The combination of progressive development in gas sensor with a micro and nano technology have potentialized the detection of various gases in huge application such as environmental monitoring system and medical diagnosis. In particular, practical applications can be widely deployed from condition monitoring of grand plantation to sophisticated physiological analysis via patent’s breath due to the capability of gas sensor to identify and quantify multiple gases [1, 2]. In order to be more pragmatic, emphasis has been placed on more functionalities such as portability and wearability. For portable and wearable gas sensor devices, electronic hardware should be flexible for a comfortable fit, and gas detection should work at low temperatures without a power supply. However, commercialized sensing materials are based on metal oxides such as SnO2, ZnO and NiO with working temperatures over 100 °C, which in principle limits application towards wearable gas sensors [3]. Therefore, it is desirable to investigate a suitable new material that can respond at lower working temperature and can be fabricated on flexible substrates. \\n               Two-dimensional transition metal carbides and/or carbonitrides (called MXenes), which are a new family of 2D materials, have attracted huge attention due to their attractive properties in different applications such as energy storage, water purification, electromagnetic interference shielding, gas sensing, etc [4]. Ti3C2 is the first discovered and most studied MXene material that is produced by selective etching of Al atoms from the Ti3AlC2 MAX phase, a hexagonal structured ternary carbide. The surface of the produced Ti3C2 nanosheets, like any other produced MXene, is terminated with oxygen, hydroxyl, and fluorine groups where the concentration of these surface functional groups is largely dependent on the synthesis method [5]. Consequently its properties are dependent on the type and concentration of these functionality groups, through which MXenes with different properties can be tailored for different applications [6]. \\n               Herein, we report for the first time to our knowledge, on gas-sensing capabilities of Ti3C2 MXene to detect various gases. We demonstrate the sensing properties of a Ti3C2 device for 100 ppm ammonia, acetone, methanol and ethanol gas bubbling at room temperature. Ti3C2 MXene was synthesized by selective removal of Al from Ti3AlC2 MAX phase using LiF salt and HCl acid in a safer way, and Ti3C2-based gas sensor was fabricated on a flexible polyimide film via simple solution method. The structure of the synthesized Ti3C2 was analyzed with XRD, SEM and EDS, and the surface condition was examined by FTIR. During the gas sensing test, its initial resistance at room temperature was around 10~20kΩ with 8µm film thickness, and it showed p type gas sensing behavior to all four different types of donor gases. The predicted gas sensing mechanism of Ti3C2 will be suggested with a concept of physisorption and chemisorption, and its gas response mechanism will be discussed. \\n               References \\n                \\n                  \\n                     \\n                        Jin, Han, Tan-Phat Huynh, and Hossam Haick. \"Self-Healable Sensors Based Nanoparticles for Detecting Physiological Markers via Skin and Breath: Toward Disease Prevention via Wearable Devices.\" Nano letters 16.7 (2016): 4194-4202.\\n                     \\n                     \\n                        Webber, Michael E., et al. \"Agricultural ammonia sensor using diode lasers and photoacoustic spectroscopy.\" Measurement Science and Technology 16.8 (2005): 1547.\\n                     \\n                     \\n                        Chung, Yoonsung, et al. \"Communication—Gas Sensing Behaviors of Electrophoretically Deposited Nickel Oxide Films from Morphologically Tailored Particles.\" Journal of the Electrochemical Society 163.13 (2016): B624-B626.B.

Although it is well accepted that supports can modify the chemistry of metal nanoparticles, systematic utilization of MSIs for achieving desired catalytic performance is still challenging.

       "  'abstract': 'The versatility of direct write techniques such as aerosol jet printing (AJP) and ink jet printing (IJP) has recently intersected with two-dimensional (2D) materials research to enable novel wearable sensors. Graphene and 2D transition metal nitrides, carbides and carbonitrides (MXenes) are of particular interest for wearable sensor applications due to their biocompatibility and multifunctional nature. However, these 2D materials must be contacted by biocompatible metals, e.g. platinum, in order to enable functional devices such as wearable and/or implantable electrochemical sensors and neural interfaces.[1 - 3] \\n               In this study, we report the printing of 2D materials, graphene, titanium carbide Mxenes (Ti3C2), and platinum nanoparticles via AJP and IJP. Ink characterization was performed with atomic force microscopy, scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM), DLS and Raman spectroscopy. Graphene sheets were obtained via solvent assisted exfoliation and then dispersed in 85:15 cyclohexanone/terpineol to formulate graphene inks at a concentration of 3.5 mg/ml.[4,5] Graphene sheets exhibited an average thickness of 16 nm +/- 15 nm and crystal domains with lateral dimensions ranging from ~50 nm to 200 nm. Platinum ink (20 wt.%) was formulated with the dispersion of platinum nanopowders and 70:30 water/ethylene glycol mix. Dispersed platinum nanoparticles exhibited an average particle size of 7.8 nm +/- 2.3 nm. Finally, an AJP compatible multi-layered MXene ink was obtained by in situ HF etching of the pre-cursor Ti3AlC2 MAX phase.[6] The obtained colloidal suspension containing 2D MXene flakes was sonicated with deionized water for 3 hours at 55 W. The resultant ink had a concentration of 1 mg/mL and an average flake size of 100 nm +/- 10 nm, as confirmed by dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements. Platinum, graphene and Ti3C2 inks have demonstrated good compatibility with an Optomec Aerosol Jet 200 and a Dimatix 2850 materials inkjet printer, while platinum and graphene have shown additional compatibility with IJP. For good electrical conductivity graphene was sintered at 390 C for one hour and platinum was sintered at 450 C for 130 hours, while MXenes showed good conductivity without sintering. \\n               Optical microscopy, SEM, stylus profilometry, and two/four-point resistance measurements were used to examine the quality of the printed MXene and platinum structures. Initial printing with MXenes resulted in feature heights ranging from ~ 620 nm to 4.80 µm, depending on the number of print passes denoted as N. Our most uniform prints were N = 15 and N = 20 having a height of 2.50 µm +/- 0.10 µm and 3.50 µm +/- 0.10 µm, respectively. Electrical resistance varied between R = 568 kΩ and R = 60 kΩ for N = 5 and N = 25 respectively. Platinum exhibited good electrical conductivity as R = 70 Ω for N = 10, having a height of 3 µm and a feature width of ~50 µm. Furthermore, the electrochemical properties of fully inkjet printed graphene electrodes on a flexible polyimide substrate for pH and electrolyte sensing were investigated. Printed electrodes consisted of a printed 1x1 cm graphene square with a total of 17 layers with printed silver contact pads and a SU-8 as a passivation layer. Electrochemical activity of inkjet printed graphene electrodes was demonstrated with both cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) measurements in a room temperature 10 mM ferricyanide aqueous solution (1 M KCl supporting electrolyte). Ag/AgCl and platinum electrodes were used as the reference and counter electrode, respectively. Additionally, pH sensing capabilities were investigated by measuring the potentiometric response of polyaniline coated graphene electrodes over three different pH values (4, 7 and 10). The response of printed and flexible graphene electrodes was comparable to that of a conventional glass electrode. \\n               In conclusion, AJP compatible Ti3C2 MXene inks along with AJP and IJP compatible platinum and graphene inks have been developed. Printing of these biocompatible materials is intended to support the fabrication of nanomaterial based flexible hybrid electronics such as biosensors for electrochemical sensing of a broad spectrum of biomarkers, and also neural interface systems. Furthermore, our results provide new fundamental insights on role of structure-property-performance correlations in printed graphene electrodes for electrochemical sensing. The combination of our works highlight the significant potential of novel material inks for additively manufactured wearable sensors. \\n               [1] Kenry et al., Microsystems Nanoeng., Sep. 2016.

       "  'abstract': 'Two-dimensional (2-D) materials are capable of handling high rates of charge in ion batteries since metal ions do not need to diffuse in a 3-D lattice structure. However graphene, which is the most well-studied 2-D material, is known to have no Li capacity. Here, adsorption of Li, as well as Na, K, and Ca on Ti3C2, one representative MXene, is predicted by first-principles density functional calculations. In our study, we observed that these alkali atoms exhibit different adsorption energies depending on the coverage. The adsorption energies of Na, K, and Ca decrease as coverage increases, while Li shows little sensitivity to variance in coverage. This observed relationship between adsorption energies and coverage of alkali ions on Ti3C2 can be explained by their effective ionic radii. A larger effective ionic radius increases interaction between alkali atoms, thus lower coverage is obtained. Our calculated capacities for Li, Na, K, and Ca on Ti3C2 are 447.8, 351.8, 191.9, and 320.0 mAh/g, respectively. Compared to materials currently used in high-rate Li and Na ion battery anodes, MXene shows promise in increasing overall battery performance.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Two-dimensional (2D) zinc oxide (ZnO) has great potential in the field of dye photocatalytic degradation. However, the photocatalytic activity is always unsatisfactory because of its small specific surface area and high carrier recombination rate. In this study, peony flower-like ZnO/Ti2C (2 wt% ZnO/Ti2C) composites were successfully prepared by simple electrostatic self-assembly method with morphology design and content adjustment of MXene Ti2C. The prepared materials displayed excellent photocatalytic degradation activity and photocorrosion resistance of methylene blue (MB) dye. After 120\\xa0min UV irradiation, the degradation rate reached 99.16%, and the apparent rate constant k was 0.03926\\xa0min−1, which was 14.76 times higher than that of pure ZnO. The photocatalytic activity almost did not decrease after 4 cycles. The introduction of Ti2C promoted the formation of tightly interfacial coupling between ZnO and Ti2C, which shortens the path of carrier transfer and promoted the direct transfer of photogenerated electrons from the valence band of ZnO to Ti2C. The specific surface area of hybrids showed distinct enlargement simultaneously, which was a benefit for enhancing the UV absorption capacity of ZnO/Ti2C composites. Meaningfully, this study provides a feasible design strategy for improving the degradation performance of 2D photocatalysts, which can provide a technical proposal for the modification design of other photocatalysts.Graphical abstract',\n",

A detailed analysis of pressurized structure, phonon dynamics, superconducting, metallization, doping together with optical property is performed. Further, the pressure-induced optimized properties and potential applications as well as the vision of engineering the vdW interactions in heterostructures are highlighted.

       "  'abstract': 'Exfoliation/restacking of 2D materials has recently been considered for the preparation of nanostructured electrode materials for supercapacitors. This approach consists in rebuilding new electrode materials from exfoliated layers of 2D materials either by restacking layers of different materials, by wrapping 3D materials with exfoliated layers, after chemical/morphological modification of those layers... with the aim of taking advantages of synergistic effects from distinct but complementary intrinsic behaviors together with the specific morphology of the resulting material. This can be, for example, to associate a 2D conductive material with a 2D pseudocapacitive material, eventually resulting in a more powerful nanocomposite electrode material [1]. This can also be about associating Faradaic layered double hydroxides (LDHs), for energy density, to more stable and powerful pseudocapacitive MnO2 [2], or opening a new macro/meso -porosity in Mxene layers for enhanced diffusion of electrolytic moieties in the reconstructed material. \\n               This paper will present our most recent results gained while exploring these various approaches. \\n               \\n                  References\\n               \\n               [1] Z.

       "  'abstract': 'Current lithium ion batteries (LIBs) can’t provide sufficient energy density due to a limiting capacity of 372 mAh/g from graphite anode and a low capacity from cathode. Therefore, searching novel electrode materials for large energy storage that can deliver much higher energy density becomes critical. Li-M (M = Si, Al, Sn) alloy batteries are in particular attracting more attention due to the conspicuous advantages on industrial availability, specific capacity and rate capability. Sn has a 3 times greater capacity of ~1000 mAh/g that allows it as one of primary candidates for the next-generation LIBs. Scientists have made numerous attempts to stabilize the Sn alloy geometry by constructing various structures. However, most of these nano-structured particles can’t long survive because of the severe agglomeration and pulverization, nevertheless some types of carbon may limit the particle growth. Here we report a rational design of 2D Sn/MXene hybrid as anode battery with long cycling (over 1000 cycles) and high rate performance (over 5C), which is based on our previous work on Sn (Kang et al Nano Letter 2018; Liu et al Nano Letter 2016; Liu et al Chem Commun 2017) and MXene (Nagui et al Adv Mater 2011). The excellent Li+/e- conductivity and strong chemical/physical bonding of the interface between MXene and Sn lead to the improved half-cell (VS Li) and full-cell (VS NMC) battery performance at both coin and pouch cell scales. The structure evolution of the hybrid composite, the SEI forming and disappearing, and the interface between electrode and electrolyte upon cycling will be investigated via electrochemical measurements and in-situ TEM technique. Our strategy based on the benefits of MXene and the major capacity contribution of loaded metal active material can elevate the development and utilization of this new type of 2D hybrid materials with a high rate capability, high storage capacity, and low voltage, making it a promising candidate for next-generation batteries.',\n",

In this minireview, we highlight the covalent functionalization of graphene and its derivatives such as graphene oxide with polymer brushes, and their application in anticorrosion within the last three years. There are some recent excellent reviews published on single layer graphene and graphene-based polymer composites for anticorrosion. However, the covalent functionalization of graphene and graphene oxide with polymer brushes for application in anticorrosion has not been addressed in those reviews. In this review, we describe first the current state of the art of covalent functionalization of graphene/graphene oxide with polymer brushes. We then discuss the application of pristine graphene as anticorrosion material and its drawbacks which can be overcome by graphene-based polymer composites. Afterwards, we discuss in detail the recent progress and development of covalent polymer functionalized graphene/graphene oxide as anticorrosion coatings, reported within the last three years. Finally, as perspective, we will briefly summarize the work on composites of polymers with other two-dimensional (2D) materials as anticorrosion coatings. Herein, hexagonal boron nitride, the most studied 2D materials after graphene, and Ti3C2Tx MXene which is the rising star of 2D transition metal carbide/nitride will be discussed.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'MXene is a variety of new two-dimensional (2D) materials with early transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides. Quantum chemical studies have been carried out on the geometries, electronic structures, stability and catalytic properties of a non-noble metal single-atom catalyst (SAC) with single Co atom anchored on MXene materials of Mo2CS2. The Co adatom anchored on top of the Mo atom of this MXene is found to be rather stable, and this SAC is appropriate for CO oxidation. The charge transfers from the surface to the adsorbed CO and O2 play a significant role in the activation of these molecules on Co1/Mo2CS2. With this catalyst, the Eley-Rideal (ER), Langmuir-Hinshelwood (LH), and Termolecular Eley-Rideal (TER) mechanisms are explored for CO oxidation. We find that, while all the three mechanisms are feasible at low temperature, Co1/Mo2CS2 possesses higher catalytic activity for CO oxidation through the TER mechanism that features an intriguing OC(OO)CO intermediate (IM) adsorbed on Co single atom. The calculated activation energy barriers of the rate-limiting step are 0.67 eV (TER), 0.78 eV (LH) and 0.88 eV (ER), respectively. The present study illustrates that it is promising to develop and design low-cost, non-noble metal SACs using MXene types of 2D materials.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'MXenes are single or few-layered two-dimensional (2D) transition metals carbides and/or nitrides successfully synthesized in 2011, with chemical composition Mn+1XnTx, where M stands for an early transition metal, X is C and/or N, Tx are a surface terminations and n = 1, 2, or 3 [1]. These materials are considered as promising candidates in many applications such as energy storage, sensing, catalysis, and optoelectronics. For instance, MXenes combine high conductivity and hydrophilicity making them interesting candidates for applications involving aqueous media and requiring good electronic properties or easy processing. Moreover, they exhibit a wide chemical variability thanks to their parent MAX phases precursors, a 150-plus member family of layered ternary carbides or nitrides with chemical composition Mn+1AXn (where the A-element mainly belong to the columns 13 and 14 of the periodic table). This offers the unique opportunity to design the MXenes on demand, with considerably different physicochemical properties for target applications [2-4]. Tuning the MXene properties is also possible through the manipulation of their surface termination groups T (i.e., T = −F, −OH, −O, or −Cl). The crucial role of the surface groups has recently triggered many studies aiming at controlling and characterizing the MXene surface structure/chemistry mainly by using different etching protocols [5]. However, the nature of the surface groups, inherited from the A element exfoliation step of the MAX phases by chemical reactions, is hardly tunable by this mean except by changing the etching protocole which might have significant impact on the quality of the synthetized MXenes.\\n               Here, we demonstrate that medium energy ion implantation can be used to modify the MXene surface functionalization, through the controlled formation of structural defects and the incorporation of foreign species in Ti3C2Tx thin films fabricated by spin coating (Fig.1 a-b). Defects created by Mn implantation in a wide fluence range (1x1014-5x1016 cm-2) are characterized at different depths by XPS on Ti2p core-level spectra, ToF-SIMS and EELS analyses. For the latest, we use an original approach that we have developed [6], allowing an estimation of the level of damage in the material by studying the C-K edge. Our results show that the 60 keV Mn implantation leads to successful incorporation of Mn in the Ti3C2 thin film. This is accompanied by the structural distortion of the Ti-C layers as evidenced by EELS experiments (Fig. 1c), preferential Ti sputtering as compared to C without any significant amorphization or phase transformation up to a fluence of 1x1016 cm-2. However, for the highest fluence studied (5x1016 cm-2), complete amorphization was observed. For the subthreshold amorphization fluence, the study of the fine structure of the O K-edge and of the electron diffraction pattern suggest the formation of extended defects in the Ti layers including the occupation of the defective Ti sites by oxygen, leading to local environment for the oxygen atoms like graphene oxide. Finally, our results show that the number of defects can be directly and in a reproductible way tunned by the implantation fluence.\\n               [1] M. Naguib, M. Kurtoglu, V. Presser, J. Lu, J.

In this paper, ZnCo2S4 core–shell nanospheres are constructed by two-step hydrothermal method.

Then, MXene nanosheets are fixed on the surface of ZnCo2S4 by electrostatic self-assembly method to improve the specific surface area of ZnCo2S4 and MXene-wrapped ZnCo2S4 composite is prepared in this work. Owing to the synergy effect between MXene nanosheets and ZnCo2S4 core–shell nanospheres, the as-prepared composite displays fast ion transfer rate and charge/discharge process. The capacity of the MXene-wrapped ZnCo2S4 composite can reach 1072 F·g−1, which is far larger than that of ZnCo2S4 (407 F·g−1) at 1 A·g−1. An ASC device is assembled, which delivers 1.7\\xa0V potential window and superior cyclic stability (95.41% capacitance retention).

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\n\\nHierarchical hollow structure with unique interfacial properties holds great potential for microwave absorption (MA). Ti3C2Tx MXene has been a hot topic due to rich interface structure, abundant defects, and functional groups. However, its overhigh permittivity and poor aggregation-resistance limit the further application. Herein, a hierarchical MXene-based hollow microsphere is prepared via a facile spray drying strategy. Within the microsphere, few-layered MXene nanosheets are separated by dispersed carbon nanotubes (CNTs), exposing abundant dielectric polarization interfaces. Besides, numerous magnetic Fe3O4 nanospheres are uniformly dispersed and confined within nano-cavities between 1D network and 2D framework. Such a novel structure simultaneously promotes interfacial polarization by ternary MXene/CNTs/Fe3O4 interfaces, enhances magnetic loss by microscale and nanoscale coupling network, enlarges conduction loss by MXene/CNTs dual-network, and optimizes impedance matching by hierarchical porous structure. Therefore, Fe3O4@Ti3C2Tx/CNTs composite achieves excellent MA property with a maximum reflection loss of −40.1 dB and an effective bandwidth of 5.8 GHz at the thickness of only 2 mm.

However, some tumor ablations are difficult to be realized completely by monotherapy due to the essential defects of monotherapy and intricate tumor microenvironment (TME). In this work, the appropriate doped Fe2+ ions are anchored into the layers of 2D ultrathin TC nanosheets (TC NSs) to synthesize a novel multifunctional nanoshell of Fe(II)-Ti3C2 (FTC) through interlayer electrostatic adsorption. FTC possesses superior photothermal conversion efficiency (PTCE) than TC NSs, attributing to the enhanced conductivity promoted by interlaminar ferrous ion-channels. Moreover, Fenton reaction based on ferrous ions endows FTC the abilities of reactive oxide species (ROS) releasing and glutathione (GSH) suppression triggered by near-infrared (NIR) laser, featuring splendid biocompatibility and curative effect in hypoxic TME. Meanwhile, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) responding in FTC reveals the potential as an integrated diagnosis and treatment nanoplatform. FTC could provide new insights into the development of multimoded synergistic nanoplatform for biological applications, especially breaking the shackles of MXenes merely used as a photo-thermal agent (PTA), adopting it to bioimaging sensor and drug loading.',\n",

However, the hunt for specific photothermal nanomaterials with distinct performance remains challenging. In this study, we successfully fabricated a bilayer hydrogel actuator consisting of an active photothermal layer from incorporated Ti3C2Tx MXene in poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) p(NIPAm)hydrogel structure and a passive layer from the N-(2-hydroxylethylpropyl)acrylamide (HEAA) hydrogel structure. The uniform and effective incorporation of MXene into the NIPAm hydrogel structures were characterized by a battery of techniques. The light responsive swelling properties of the MXene-embedded NIPAm-based hydrogel demonstrated fully reversible and repeatable behavior in the light on–off regime for up to ten consecutive cycles. The effect of MXene loading, the shape of the actuator, and the light source effects on the bilayer NIPAm-HEAA hydrogel structure were investigated. The bilayer hydrogel with MXene loading of 0.3% in the NIPAm hydrogel exhibited a 200% change of the bending angle in terms of its bidirectional shape/volume after 100 s exposure to white light at an intensity of 70 mW cm−2. Additionally, the bending behavior under real sunlight was evaluated, showing the material’s potential applicability in practical environments.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\nIn this study, a sensitive and stable electrochemical sensor based on CuO-CeO2/MXene is constructed for the continuous detection of H2O2. CuO-CeO2 nanomaterials are applied as a catalyst to promote the electrolysis of H2O2 on the electrode surface as well as amplify the reduction current for the aim of H2O2 detection. MXene serves as a catalyst carrier for CuO-CeO2 and enhances the electron transfer rate during the reduction process of H2O2. Furthermore, the generation of hydroxyl radical during the decomposition of H2O2 is demonstrated by UV-vis spectrum and first-principles calculation to explore the reaction mechanism. The electrolysis rate of H2O2 is obtained as 0.61 × 103 M-1 s-1 by chronoamperometry. Based on the good properties, the electrochemical sensor fabricated by CuO-CeO2/MXene exhibits high sensitivity, stability, and reproducibility. A good linear relationship is ranged from 5.0 μM to 100 μM with a low detection limit of 1.67 μM for H2O2 detection. Besides, the current signal is stable and repeatable when continuously testing H2O2 content, which can calculate a reliable H2O2 concentration value for practical application. The proposed approach sheds light on the rational design and assembly of electrochemical sensors and its relevant catalytic mechanism study.',\n",

However, most syntheses involve HF, which is highly corrosive and harmful to lithium-ion battery and supercapacitor performance.

The process is free of fluorine and yields multilayer Ti3C2Tx with ca. 92\\u2005wt\\u2009% in purity (using 27.5\\u2009m NaOH, 270\\u2009°C).

In addition to intrinsic flame retardancy strategy, the additive-type flame retardants have attracted increasing attention due to low commercial cost and easy fabrication craft. However, traditional additive-type flame retardants usually need high addition amount to achieve a desirable effect, which causes many side-effects on the overall performance of polymer materials, such as deteriorated mechanical property and processability. At present, two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials have also been applied to reduce the fire hazards of polymer (nano)composites with the coupling of barrier function and catalysis as well as carbonization effect. Even though most research work mainly focus on graphene-based flame retardants, more emerging two-dimensional nanomaterials are taking away research attention, due to their complementary and unique properties, mainly including hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), metal organic frameworks (MOF), carbon nitride (CN), titanium carbide (MXene) and black phosphorene (BP). In this review, except for graphene, the flame retardant mechanism involving different layered nanomaterials are also reviewed. Meanwhile, the functionalization method and flame retardancy effect of different layered nanomaterials are emphatically discussed for offering an effective reference to solve the fire hazards of polymer materials.

Such a hybrid catalyst enhances durability and improves both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activities compared with the Pd/C catalysts. The mass specific activity and specific activity of the Pd/Ti3C2Tx–CNT catalyst are 4.4 and 3.3 times that of Pd/C for ORR, respectively.

For $\\\\mathrm{M}{\\\\mathrm{o}}_{1.33}\\\\mathrm{C}{\\\\mathrm{T}}_{z}$ it is more likely that variable range hopping within individual flakes is rate limiting. At higher temperatures, a thermally activated process emerges in all cases. It follows that improved fabrication processes should lead to considerable improvements in the electrical transport of Mo-based MXenes.',\n",

Their advantages are based on their unique and tunable electronic and optical properties, which depend on the modulation of transition metal elements or surface functional groups. In this paper, we have presented a comprehensive review of MXenes to suggest an insightful perspective on future nanophotonic and optoelectronic device applications based on advanced synthesis processes and theoretically predicted or experimentally verified material properties. Recently developed optoelectronic and photonic devices, such as photodetectors, solar cells, fiber lasers, and light-emitting diodes are summarized in this review. Wide-spectrum photodetection with high photoresponsivity, high-yield solar cells, and effective saturable absorption were achieved by exploiting different MXenes. Further, the great potential of MXenes as an electrode material is predicted with a controllable work function in a wide range (1.6–8 eV) and high conductivity (~104 S/cm), and their potential as active channel material by generating a tunable energy bandgap is likewise shown. MXene can provide new functional building blocks for future generation nanophotonic device applications.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Introduction: Recently, nanotechnology products have been used for a variety of applications including the medical field. Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials have attracted a growing interest due to its unique properties and ultrathin structure. One common example is MXene, which can be used for cancer photothermal therapy. Methodology: In this study, two 2D nanomaterials, MXene and MXene/Au nanocomposite were fabricated as photothermal agents. To mimic physiological tumor microenvironment, nanocomposites were tested on MDA-231 breast cancer cells under fluid shear stress (~ 0.1 Dyn/cm2 ) using a perfusion setup. The uptake of these nanomaterials was tested under fluid flow compared to static culture, to assess influence of shear stress in material uptake. The uptake was assessed using confocal microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (EDS) and transmission electron microscopy. Furthermore, viability assessment was performed after exposing the treated cells to laser at different power densities and durations by live/dead assay. Results: This study revealed that there is insignificant difference in cellular uptake under fluid flow compared to static culture. Although when exposed to PTT laser irradiation, MXene alone could increase the temperature up to 100 ° C, its cellular uptake is very low (~ 3 ug/ml) which could only increase the temperature up to 44 ° C which was not sufficient to induce protein denaturation and cellular damage. Conclusion: MXene can be a good candidate for PTT for cancer treatment, but its cellular internalization should be enhanced. This can be achieved by coating the MXene surface and labeling the material with certain ligands that is cancer cell specific.',\n",

However, it is urgent to find a simple and effective method to reduce the light reflectivity of the 2D surface to improve the light-to-heat conversion efficiency. A 2D nano-self-assembly material coating (NiS2@Ti3C2) realized by a simple hydrothermal method, which enables unique-sized nano-NiS2 crystals and 2D Ti3C2–MXenes to self-assemble on a 3D scale, is innovatively proposed. Such a preparation method can construct a unique multilayer structure for multistage diffuse reflection of incident light, so that the MXene nanomaterial can achieve a light absorption rate of >90% in a wide spectral range. The composite is theoretically verified through optical simulation and first principles, and a higher light-to-heat conversion performance is achieved experimentally (61.7\\u2009°C surface equilibrium temperature, 1\\u2009sun). Compared with other similar materials, the assembled MXene seawater steam generator achieves a higher steam generation rate (1.27\\u2009kg\\u2009m−2\\u2009h−1) and light-to-heat conversion efficiency (83.84%) under 1\\u2009sun.

[1] The sensor revolution can significantly impact on outpatient care and management of chronical diseases by offering real-time condition monitoring. The combination of many technology is on the verge of producing this dramatic advance, and the significance placed on the development of sensor performance. [2] Recently, two-dimensional (2D) nanostructured materials have been regarded as instrumental sensing materials due to their working ability at low temperature. One attractive approach to enhance performance of 2D materials-based sensor is to hybridize with metal oxide. By grafting two nanostructured materials, sensing performance can be highly advanced by hybridization effects. [3] Another innovative strategy is to adapt newly discovered 2D materials. 2D transition metal carbides and/or carbonitrides (called MXenes) have recently shown excellent properties particularly in energy storage, and water purification applications. [4] Boundless combination of constituent elements and ordered structure in MXenes provides many opportunities to tailor its properties for different applications. \\n               In this study, 2D nanostructured nanomaterials and their hybrids were explored to develop wearable chemical sensor for precise health monitoring systems. Graphene oxide (GO) and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) were studied to understand the effect of surface dangling bonds on gas sensing properties. To enhance sensing performance, 2D nanomaterials was combined with metal oxides. The gas sensing performance of the GO/TiO2 hybrid was improved by decorating titanium dioxide (TiO2). [5] After photo-reduction, the gas sensing behavior was converted from n-type to p-type with extended long-term stability. Moreover, 2D MXene was introduced as a promising room-temperature sensing material with their intriguing surface chemistry. The capability of titanium carbide (Ti3C2Tx) to sense an array of VOC gases was demonstrated, and its possible sensing mechanism was proposed in terms of the interaction between sensing species and the oxygen terminated surface of MXene. Another MXene material, vanadium carbide (V2CTx), was also investigated. 2D V2CTx gas sensors showed outstanding gas sensing performance including high sensitivity toward non-polar gases such as hydrogen and methane. Transformation of ordered structure and constituent elements of MXenes largely influenced on interaction between analyte and MXenes showing outstanding selectivity and limit of detection to non-polar gases. \\n               References \\n                     \\n                        Gravina, Raffaele, et al. \"Multi-sensor fusion in body sensor networks: State-of-the-art and research challenges.\" Information Fusion 35 (2017): 68-80.\\n                     \\n                     \\n                        Yao, Shanshan, Puchakayala Swetha, and Yong Zhu. \"Nanomaterial‐Enabled Wearable Sensors for Healthcare.\" Advanced healthcare materials 7.1 (2018): 1700889.\\n                     \\n                     \\n                        Chatterjee, Shyamasree Gupta, et al. \"Graphene–metal oxide nanohybrids for toxic gas sensor: a review.\" Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical 221 (2015): 1170-1181.\\n                     \\n                     \\n                        Anasori, Babak, Maria R.

Previous studies have also shown that MXene can exhibit excellent potential for electrochemical energy storage and water treatment applications due to its high electronic conductivity, good chemical and structural stability, and high surface area [1-2]. More recently, our group has found significant potential in utilization of MXene electrodes for flow-assisted electrochemical systems such as capacitive deionization (CDI) and electrochemical flow capacitors (EFCs). For CDI, along with high conductivity and surface area, hydrophilicity of MXenes seems to work well for better pore accessibility. Similarly, easy dispersability in water and high surface charge for solution stability were also found to enable much higher active material loading for flowable electrode systems, which can open up a new plethora of possibilities.

Herein, the authors propose a strategy to significantly reduce the superficial lattice tensile strain by means of incorporating an inorganic 2D Cl-terminated Ti3C2 (Ti3C2Clx) MXene into the bulk and surface of CsPbBr3 film. Arising from the strong interaction between Cl atoms in Ti3C2Clx and the under-coordinated Pb2+ in CsPbBr3 lattice, the expanded perovskite lattice is compressed and confined to act as a lattice “tape”, in which the Pb\\uf8ffCl bond plays a role of “glue” and the 2D Ti3C2 immobilizes the lattice. Finally, the defective surface is healed and a champion efficiency as high as 11.08% with an ultrahigh open-circuit voltage up to 1.702\\xa0V is achieved on the best all-inorganic CsPbBr3 PSC, which is so far the highest efficiency record for this kind of PSCs. Furthermore, the unencapsulated device demonstrates nearly unchanged performance under 80% relative humidity over 100 days and 85\\xa0°C over 30 days.',\n",

Since the synthesis of the first family member in 2011 by Yury Gogotsi and colleagues, MXenes have quickly become attractive for a variety of research fields due to their exceptional properties. Despite the fact that this new family of 2D materials was discovered only about ten years ago, the number of scientific publications related to MXene almost doubles every year. Thus, in 2021 alone, more than 2000 papers are expected to be published, which indicates the relevance and prospects of MXenes. The current paper critically analyzes the structural features, properties, and methods of synthesis of MXenes based on recent available research data. We demonstrate the recent trends of MXene applications in various fields, such as environmental pollution removal and water desalination, energy storage and harvesting, quantum dots, sensors, electrodes, and optical devices.

The simple methods of mechanical mixing and drop-casting of Ti3C2TX and MWCNTs were carried out to prepare sensing electrode of Ti3C2TX/MWCNTs/GCE. The composite and topography, especially the surface functional groups of Ti3C2TX/MWCNTs were analyzed by XRD, SEM, FTIR, XPS, and Raman spectrum. The results turned out that Ti3C2TX was characteristic by accordion-like 2D nanostructure with the surfaces terminated with −OH, −F, and =O. When combining with acid pretreated, the interaction between the functional groups of Ti3C2TX and MWCNTs facilitated the convenience and reproducibility of the robust modified electrodes and could make Ti3C2TX/MWCNTs/GCE possess good synergistic catalytic acceleration by increasing the electron transfer efficiency as well as adsorption and aggregation of MOP analyte onto the electrode surface. Versatile electrochemical measurements of CV, DPV and EIS were used to investigate the electrochemical performance of Ti3C2TX/MWCNTs/GCE sensing platform.

To achieve promising electrochemical performance in supercapacitors, aqueous electrolytes are favored for Mxene so far while using organic electrolytes commonly fails to deliver high power/energy densities due to the limited ionic diffusion between the hydrophilic Mxene intralayers in organic solvents such as acetonitrile or propylene carbonate, despite the virtues of high potential window and wide temperature-tolerance range of these organic electrolytes.\\n               The energy densities of Mxene in various aqueous electrolytes (such as H2SO4(aq), K2SO4(aq), Na2SO4(aq), and KOH(aq))1-4 reported so far are as high as (400-500) F/g, which is quite impressive given that in organic electrolytes the values of which is only (70-100) F/g at slow scan rates5,6.

However, high-entropy atomic layers with fully exposed active sites are difficult to synthesize since their phases are easily segregated. Here, it is demonstrated that high-entropy atomic layers of transition-metal carbide (HE-MXene) can be produced via the selective etching of novel high-entropy MAX (also termed Mn+1AXn (n\\xa0= 1, 2, 3), where M represents an early transition-metal element, A is an element mainly from groups 13–16, and X stands for C and/or N) phase (HE-MAX) (Ti1/5V1/5Zr1/5Nb1/5Ta1/5)2AlC, in which the five transition-metal species are homogeneously dispersed into one MX slab due to their solid-solution feature, giving rise to a stable transition-metal carbide in the atomic layers owing to the high molar configurational entropy and correspondingly low Gibbs free energy. Additionally, the resultant high-entropy MXene with distinct lattice distortions leads to high mechanical strain into the atomic layers. Moreover, the mechanical strain can efficiently guide the nucleation and uniform growth of dendrite-free lithium on HE-MXene, achieving a long cycling stability of up to 1200 h and good deep stripping–plating levels of up to 20 mAh cm−2.',\n",

The tremendous characteristics of MXenes, i.e., high surface area, high metallic conductivity, ease of functionalization, biocompatibility, activated metallic hydroxide sites, and hydrophilicity, make them the best aspirant for applications in energy storage, catalysis, sensors, electronics, and environmental remediation. Due to their exceptional physicochemical properties and multifarious chemical compositions, MXenes have gained considerable attention for applications in water treatment and desalination in recent times. It is vital to understand the current status of MXene applications in desalination in order to define the roadmap for the development of MXene-based materials and endorse their practical applications in the future. This paper critically reviews the recent advancement in the synthesis of MXenes and MXene-based composites for applications in desalination. The desalination potential of MXenes is portrayed in detail with a focus on ion-sieving membranes, capacitive deionization, and solar desalination. The ion removal mechanism and regeneration ability of MXenes are also summarized to get insight into the process. The key challenges and issues associated with the synthesis and applications of MXenes and MXene-based composites in desalination are highlighted. Lastly, research directions are provided to guarantee the synthesis and applications of MXenes in a more effective way.

While high-temperature annealing in the presence of a nitrogen source has been one popular method to introduce nitrogen, annealing exfoliated multilayered MXenes typically brings about incomplete delamination and the treatment of delaminated monolayer MXenes often leads to irreversible restacking. Here, starting from the typical carbide precursor, we developed an aqueous colloid containing monolayered nitrogen-doped titanium carbide sheets with excellent dispersity and stability. This achievement is critically dependent on the retaining of the hydrophilic surface of host layers during annealing treatment. The successful realization of nitrogen doping into individual MXene monolayers resulted in enhanced electrical conductivity and redox reactivity, for which the sample exhibited excellent capacitive electrochemical performance (586\\u2009F/g at a scan rate of 5\\u2009mV/s) and cycling stability (capacitance retention of 96.2% after 104 cycles at 5\\u2009A/g).

Their outstanding electrical conductivities of >104\\u2009S\\u2009cm−1 and 2D morphology offer an efficient alternative to highly conductive metals in applications requiring high electrical conductivity. In addition, the low density, mechanical flexibility, easy processability, and structural controllability of MXenes further widen their application scope to compete with existing conventional 2D materials. In particular, as the characteristics of MXenes match the demands of efficient electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials, MXenes have become promising shields in next-generation portable electronics. The excellent metallic conductivity of MXenes promotes the reflection of electromagnetic waves (EMWs), whereas the multilayered structure and surface terminations enhance EMW absorption through multiple reflections and various polarization losses. With further structural design, MXene composites and hybrids can find real applications in smart fifth-generation (5G) electronics.',\n",

How to design and fabricate an ideal gas sensor working at room temperature is still challenging and attracting lots of interest. Two-dimensional (2D) materials with ultra-thin structure have been demonstrated as a family of ideal candidates to achieve this goal. Among them, Ti3C2Tx MXene, a kind of layered sheet synthesized by selectively etching MAX phases materials, shows remarkable potential to be the sensitive materials solely or in a composite. However, their designing rules are still lacking critical thinking from the viewpoint of the intrinsic property of Ti3C2Tx MXene based materials. In this article, two critical features, i.e., the thickness of the sensitive materials, and the scope of the analytes, are elaborated towards Ti3C2Tx MXene based gas sensors after characterizing the performance of sensing reducing gases (NH3 and CO) and oxidizing gas (NO2). First, the thinner the Ti3C2Tx MXene sensitive layer, the better the sensitivity. Second, the Ti3C2Tx MXene based gas sensor is not suitable for strong and moderate oxidation gas due to its ease of oxidation. These two rules are demonstrated, and could be considered with priority both in the future researches and practical applications.',\n",

Compared to pure Ti3C2Tx, the nanocomposite had a better reversible capacity at different current densities and had no attenuation after 200 cycles, which is one time higher than pure Ti3C2Tx. The improvement in the specific capacity was due to the excellent electrical conductivity and the unique structure of RGO, in which a charge transfer bridge was built among the Ti3C2Tx flakes.

However, challenges arise due to the excessively high permittivity and the difficulty of surface modification of few-layered MXenes severely, which infect the microwave absorption performance. Herein, for the first time, a carefully designed and optimized electrostatic self-assembly strategy to fabricate magnetized MXene-rGO/CoNi film was reported. Inside the synthesized composite film, rGO nanosheets decorated with highly dispersed CoNi nanoparticles are interclacted into MXene layers, which effectively suppresses the originally self-restacked of MXene nanosheets, resulting in a reduction of high permittivity. In addition, owing to the strong magnetic coupling between the magnetic FeCo alloy nanoparticles on the rGO substrate, the entire MXene-rGO/CoNi film exhibits a strong magnetic loss capability. Moreover, the local dielectric polarized fields exist at the continuous hetero-interfaces between 2D MXene and rGO further improve the capacity of microwave loss. Hence, the synthesized composite film exhibits excellent microwave absorption property with a maximum reflection loss value of −\\xa054.1\\xa0dB at 13.28\\xa0GHz.

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\n\\nThe application of Li–S batteries has been hindered by the shuttling behavior and sluggish reaction kinetics of polysulfides. Here an effective polysulfide immobilizer and catalytic promoter is developed by proposing oxygen-vacancy-rich TinO2n−1 quantum dots (OV–TnQDs) decorated on porous carbon nanosheets (PCN), which are modulated using Ti3C2Tx MXene as starting materials. The TnQDs not only confine polysulfides through strong chemisorption but also promote polysulfide conversion via redox-active catalysis. The introduction of oxygen vacancies further boosts the immobilization and conversion of polysulfides by lowering the adsorption energy and shortening the bond lengths. The PCN provides a physical polysulfide confinement as well as a flexible substrate preventing OV–TnQDs from aggregation. Moreover, the two building blocks are conductive, thereby effectively improving the electron/charge transfer. Finally, the ultrasmall size of QDs along with the porous structure endows OV–TnQDs@PCN with large specific surface area and pore volume, affording adequate space for S loading and volume expansion. Therefore, the OV–TnQDs@PCN/S delivers a high S loading (79.1 wt%), good rate capability (672 mA h g−1 at 2 C), and excellent long-term cyclability (88% capacity retention over 1000 cycles at 2 C).

Two-dimensional (2D) nano-laminated materials are imperious as electrocatalysts due to their phenomenal properties and extensive scope of applications. In this work, we report a greener way of synthesizing MXene without hydrofluoric acid (HF) treatment and demonstrated its excellent electrochemical characteristics as an overall water-splitting catalyst. Cl-terminated MXenes (Ti3C2Cl2) were synthesized via a molten salt approach, in which the MAX phase (Ti3AlC2) was reacted with copper chloride (CuCl2) salt followed by thermal treatment at a temperature of 550°C for 5\\xa0hours. The resulting Cl-terminated MXene was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscope, Raman, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, energy dispersive X-ray analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and electrochemical testing was performed in the alkaline media for oxygen evolution reactions (OER) and hydrogen evolution reactions (HER).

       "  'abstract': 'Strain sensors with good stability are vital to the development of wearable healthcare monitoring systems. However, the design of strain sensor with both duration stability and environmental stability is still a challenge. In this work, we propose an ultra-stable and washable strain sensor by embedding a coupled composite film of carbon nanotube (CNT) and Ti3C2Tx MXene into polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) matrix. The composite strain sensor with embedded microstructure and uneven surface makes it conformal to skin, while the CNT/MXene sensing layer exhibits a resistance sensitive to strain. This sensor shows reliable responses at different frequencies and with long-term cycling durability (over 1,000 cycles). Meanwhile, the CNT/MXene/PDMS composite strain sensor provides the advantages of superior anti-interference to temperature change and water washing. The results demonstrate less than 10% resistance changes as the temperature rises from −20 to 80 °C or after sonication in water for 120 min, respectively. The composite sensor is applied to monitor human joint motions, such as bending of finger, wrist and elbow. Moreover, the simultaneous monitoring of the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal and joint movement while riding a sports bicycle is demonstrated, enabling the great potential of the as-fabricated sensor in real-time human healthcare monitoring.',\n",

The intercalation of foreign species, including but not limited to proton, cations, organic ions, and solvents, is demonstrated as one of the dominant facts during the energy storage process of MXenes, through which interlayer spacing of MXenes can be reversibly tuned, followed with reversible redox reactions on the surface of MXenes. Such a mechanism provides MXenes extremely high capacitance up to 1500\\xa0F\\xa0cm−3, in aqueous acidic electrolyte. In addition, because of the versatile terminations on their surface, the intercalation of ions into MXenes can simultaneously induce the reversible transformation of their electronic structure to trigger some other phenomenon, for example, electrochromic effect, which has great potential on electrochromic smart window—an extended application of ECs. Accordingly, regulating and facilitating the intercalation in MXenes is of great significance for MXene-based ECs. In this review, we summarize the recent progress on the intercalation in MXenes towards ECs, discussing on the intercalated species, working mechanisms, and methods to promote the intercalation. Furthermore, we prospect the future research directions of intercalation of MXenes in ECs, such as the combination of simulation and experiment on finding the best intercalation species, precisely controlling the interlayer spacing and beyond, to boost the electrochemical performance of MXene toward practical applications and multi-functional devices.',\n",

At\\xa0>\\xa0MIC of MXene, the MXene-functionalized bacteriophage would be much more active in attacking the bacteria because of the high specificity for host receptors’ recognition and targeting ability of bacteriophage and bacterial surface negative charge when comparing to the phage alone. Also, the induced positive surface moieties drive MXene nanofragments toward the negative surface charge of bacteria. The main mechanisms are the specific targeting capacity of bacteriophages, often by lysing the host and bursting out, and the physical interaction of MXene nanofragments with the bacterial cell membrane, which may rupture the cell wall in microbial death. The results described that the Ti3C2 MXene significantly enhanced the bacteriophage adsorption rate and stability over long-standing cultivation in aquatic environments providing superior antibacterial efficacy against the bacterial cells target. The Ti3C2 MXene-laden bacteriophage demonstrated a fast, efficient attaching to bacterial host cells, high antibacterial potential, and reduced 99.99% of the artificial contamination in water samples. Interestingly, no re-growth of target bacteria was observed in the samples during the experiment period, and the count of bacteria constantly remained below the detection threshold. This research raises attention in proposing a novel antibacterial agent to be synthesized through a simple one-step technique devoid of shortcomings of post-treatments in conventional antibacterial treatments.Graphical abstractDownload : Download high-res image (286KB)Download : Download full-size image',\n",

Consequently, the negatively charged surface can facilitate the compounding of MXenes with other positively charged materials and prevent MXenes from aggregating with some negatively charged substances, thus promoting the formation of a stable dispersion. The MXene-based composites have better electrochemical performance than both precursors due to synergistic effects. This review elaborates and discusses the development of MXene-based composites.

       "  'abstract': 'Supercapacitors (SC) turned out to be efficient devices for electrochemical energy storage thanks to their high energy density vs. classical surface capacitors- and high power density vs. batteries. In the absence of electrode components prone to react with the electrolyte, charges are stored in the pore space in a purely capacitive way under the form of electrical double-layer EDL at the solid-liquid interface [1, 2]. In several cases, additional pseudo-capacitive energy storage appears through redox reactions, underpotential deposition of metals or -to a lower extent- to ions intercalation [3]. This may also lead eventually to charge losses. \\n               The optimization of supercapacitors can be facilitated using electrode and electrolyte models that capture the physics at the local scale to better understand the charge and mass transfer phenomena governing their behavior. Indeed, SC characterization is still based on relatively simple models based on macroscopic parameters that are generally determined according to voltage evolution during constant current charge and discharge. The electrical equivalent circuit (EEC) often includes only an equivalent series resistance and a capacitance tied up to the average pore population governing their dynamic behavior [1, 2]. In order to account for pore size distribution within the electrodes, EEC consisting of two or more branches of resistances and capacitances in series are sometimes used [1, 2], although some parameters may appear to be correlated. \\n               In addition to the charge/discharge behavior, Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) is another extensively used tool for characterizing electrochemical systems [2, 4]. Since single or multiple branches RC EECs based on surface reaction assumption are not adapted to the frequency domain, SC impedance spectra are usually modelled using Transmission Line Models (TLM) [2, 4] accounting for the volumetric character of the electrodes. TLM are however rarely applied for SC characterization in the time domain, and in the few cases that exist, not under the form of simple analytical expressions [2]. \\n               In order to yield a basis for SC modelling and characterization, we present a parameter study comparing different model approaches. They can be applied to purely capacitive and pseudo-capacitive SC with the ultimate objective to derive a model able to capture part of the physics at the local scale and to describe the SC behavior in both the time and frequency domains. \\n               As an example we compare the parameters identified in the time and frequency domains on different types of supercapacitor yarns developed by Gao’s group at NCSU [5], including pure double-layer capacitive reduced Graphene Oxide (rGO) yarn SCs and titanium carbide (MXene) – rGO yarn SCs presenting an additional pseudo-capacitive behavior and potentially ion intercalation [3]. In these flexible 2D material based devices, the active components, 2D flakes, are stacked together in distinct morphologies (either smoothly packed with grooves on fiber surfaces, or highly wrinkled via cation crosslinking), wherein different porosity and pore distributions exist. Experimental results as reported by Dr. Gao’s group exhibit dramatically different specific capacitances and rate capabilities. \\n               \\n                  Figure Caption\\n               \\n               \\n               Left: Scheme of the MXene – rGO yarn SC structure; right: Nyquist plot of the MXene-rGO Sc impedance data and interpolation curves obtained with a purely capacitive (dashed line) and a pseudo-capacitive (full line) TLM model. \\n               \\n                  References\\n               \\n               [1] L.

       "  'abstract': 'Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal carbides/nitrides (MXenes) have shown promise for a range of applications due to their unique physical and chemical properties. The high electrical conductivity, 2D and layered structure, and rich surface chemistry of MXenes have sparked great interest in their properties as electrode materials for energy storage devices. MXenes are particularly of high interest because they can store charge in the bulk of the electrode through ultrafast intercalation of ions and fast and reversible redox reactions. To date, about 30 different MXenes with a general formula of Mn+1XnTx (M is a transition metal, X is carbon and/or nitrogen, n=1,2, and 3, and Tx represents different functional groups present at their surface) are synthesized by selective etching of the A layer atoms (i.e. Al) from MAX phases (e. g. Ti2AlC), a large group of layered ternary carbides and nitrides.1 However, similar to other 2D materials, the applications of MXenes in batteries and supercapacitors is dependent on their assembly into electrode structures with high electrical and ionic conductivities. The main focus of this talk is our group’s recent research on the assembly of MXene flakes into electrode structures with high energy and power densities. We have found that the electrochemical properties of MXene electrodes are highly dependent on the size of MXene flakes used in their fabrications.2,3 Controlling the flake size in the electrode structures leads to significant improvements in their specific capacitance and rate capability. Furthermore, our recent studies on the assembly of multilayer MXenes films and particles using electrostatic assembly methods will be discussed. The electrodes fabricated by these methods show superior chemical and electrochemical stabilities as well as energy storage capability.4 Finally, our work on 3D assembly of MXenes through a versatile 3D printing process will be presented. \\n               \\n                  References\\n               \\n               (1) Anasori, B.; Lukatskaya, M.

       "  'abstract': 'Lithium sulfur (Li-S) battery is considered the next generation lithium ion batteries for energy storage. However, several issues have to be addressed before the full potential of Li-S battery can be realized. The intrinsically low electronic conductivity of sulfur renders incomplete material utilization; the dissolution of charge/discharge intermediates, lithium polysulfides, results in the shuttle phenomenon that leads to low a coulombic efficiency and fast capacity fading upon cycling; the 80% volume expansion of sulfur upon full lithiation changes the electrode structure and shortens battery cycle life. Magnéli phase Ti4O7 is known for its high electronic conductivity, which is as high as that of metal, and the polar nature of the compound allows strong chemisorption of lithium polysulfides onto Ti4O7 surface. In this study, Magnéli phase Ti4O7 nanotube array (Ti4O7 NTA) grown on a titanium nitride mesh is synthesized via anodization of titanium mesh followed by high-temperature reduction under a hydrogen atmosphere. The effect of the duration of the reduction reaction is investigated, and from X-ray diffraction patterns, a 45-minute reaction time generates a product that most closely resembles pure Magnéli phase Ti4O7. Sulfur is introduced inside the Ti4O7 NTA via electrodeposition followed by melt-infusion under vacuum. The electrodeposition of sulfur onto the free-standing Ti4O7 NTA electrode allows a precise control of the areal loading of sulfur, simply via adjusting the duration of electrodeposition under a constant current density of 20mA/cm2. A conductive carbon coating is applied onto the sulfur-incorporated Ti4O7 NTA mesh to further confine sulfur inside the Ti4O7 nanotubes. This produces a composite material of C-S-Ti4O7 The Ti4O7 NTA provides sulfur with a large electronically conductive and strong polysulfide-absorbing surface that facilitates the redox chemistry of sulfur. The NTA structure promises ample access of electrolyte to sulfur, and allows a high areal sulfur loading in the cathode. Excellent battery performance is obtained using this composite as the cathode material. \\n               Under a moderate sulfur loading in the range of 1.3~2.8mg/cm2, a high initial specific capacity (1604mAh/g at 0.05C), ultra-low capacity decay rates (0.0322% per cycle, Figure (a)) for 1800 cycles, and good rate capability (660mAh/g at 2C and 500mAh/g and 4C, Figure (b)) are achieved. Under a higher sulfur loading in the range of 3.5~4.8mg/cm2, stable cycling (capacity decay rates below 0.10% per cycle, Figure (c)) with very high values areal capacity (4.97mAh/cm2 at 0.05C, 3.82mAh/cm2 0.1C, and 2.74 mAh/cm2 at 0.2C) are obtained, making a high-volumetric-energy-density Li-S battery more practical. The low capacity decay rate and the high areal capacity in this study are among the best reported polar sulfur hosts such as graphitic carbon nitride C3N4, α-MnO2, MXene phase Ti2C, Co9S8, and Magnéli phase Ti4O7 nanoparticles. The interaction between Magnéli phase Ti4O7 and lithium polysulfides is investigated via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. It is discovered that the interaction is of a redox nature, where titanium atoms on Ti4O7 NTA are partially reduced while sulfur atoms in lithium polysulfides are partially oxidized with peaks corresponding to sulfate and sulfite becoming more dominant when lithium polysulfides are in contact with Ti4O7 NTA. The positive effects of Ti4O7 NTA and those of carbon coating are studied via cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. It is found that the Ti4O7 NTA decreases the charge transfer resistance of the Li-S cell, and that the carbon coating produces a stable cycling performance through gradually decreasing polarization as reflected by a lowering of overpotential during charge and discharge.\\n                 \\n               \\n                  \\n                     \\n                  \\n               \\n               Figure 1',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Titanium carbide (Ti3C2Tx, also called Mxene), uniquely combining metallic conductivity with hydrophilicity, has attracted burgeoning attention in batteries and supercapacitors application since reported in 2013. To achieve promising electrochemical performance in supercapacitors, aqueous electrolytes are favored for Mxene so far while using organic electrolytes commonly fails to deliver high power/energy densities due to the limited ionic diffusion between the hydrophilic Mxene intralayers in organic solvents such as acetonitrile or propylene carbonate, despite the virtues of high potential window and wide temperature-tolerance range of these organic electrolytes.\\n               The energy densities of Mxene in various aqueous electrolytes (such as H2SO4(aq), K2SO4(aq), Na2SO4(aq), and KOH(aq))1-4 reported so far are as high as (400-500) , which is quite impressive given that in organic electrolytes the values of which is only (70-100) at slow scan rates5,6. Raising the energy storage capacity of Mxene in organic electrolytes will be of significant impact not only to improve the energy density through utilizing the high working voltage window, but also to extending the possible application in extreme conditions such as low temperature environment.\\n               Herein, to explore the possibility of improving Mxene’s energy density in organic electrolytes, an unique structure of Mxene/graphene nano-sponge, comprised of “quasi-nanotube” like structures, has been fabricated, where the graphene skeleton serves as ionic conducting pathway as well as mechanical robust support, the synergistic effects of Mxene/graphene nanocomposites as electrode material has been observed, together with quite peculiar and interesting increase of specific capacitance (nearly 60%-70%) during cycling (as shown in Fig.1, in which Mxene only takes up 40 wt%. Higher the Mxene ratio is, higher the specific capacitance is; for examples, the specific capacitances before cycling of 90 wt% Mxene increase by ~3.87 times compared to that of 40 wt% Mxene).\\n               Furthermore, together with investigation on structural transformation, extensive qualitative analysis are also performed on the ionic behavior and charge storage of Mxene/graphene nanocomposites in Et4NBF4 in Acetonitrile (AN) and in Propylene Carbonate (PC) solvents, to study the influences of graphene skeleton and organic solvents on ionic diffusion and specific capacitance, to provide guidance in designing Mxene-based composite electrode for more advanced performance.\\n               Reference\\n               [1] X.F.

       "  'abstract': 'To overcome the subordinate electrochemical performance of the pseudocapacitor, it is essential to design two-dimensional (2D) electroactive nanostructured material with enormous electroactive sites on the highly conductive current collector for enriching the rates of reversible charge transfer reactions. Herein, a scalable strategy was employed to prepare the electrodes by depositing pseudocapacitive materials on a three-dimensional (3D) free-standing highly conductive hollow multilayered graphene foam (HGF) synthesized through a template assisted-chemical vapor deposition (TA-CVD) method for the first time. The stable nanostructured monoclinic tungsten oxide (m-WO3) nanoparticles and 2D transition metal carbide (Ti3C2Tx-Mxene) sheets were bilaterally loaded on inner and outer sides of 3D HGF by a unipolar electrodeposition (UPED) method and a drop casting method, respectively. This free-standing electrode exhibited exceptional specific capacitance (Cs) of 487 F/g (439 mF/cm2) at 2 mA/cm2, outstanding rate performance and extraordinary cycling stability of 92.9 % over 5000 cycles owing to its significant metallic conductivity and reversible redox reactions of hydrophilic 2D Ti3C2Tx-Mxene. To assemble asymmetric pseudocapacitor, a MWCNT/RuO2 electrode with tiny RuO2 was also synthesized through a simple and inexpensive layer-by-layer (LBL) method. The obtained flexible asymmetric solid-state pseudocapacitor (FASC) illustrated 2-fold wider potential of 1.4 V in an acidic electrolyte when compared with Mxene based symmetric supercapacitor. This FASC displayed excellent Cs of 152.2 F/g at 5 mV/s, high energy density of 18 Wh/kg at 497 W/kg and an outstanding capacity retention of 93.3 % over 10000 GCD cycles with superb coulombic efficiencies of 99 ~ 100 %. In addition, the extraordinary demonstration performance of this FASC device by driving light emitting diodes (LEDs) and digital stopwatch signified its real-world applicability in electronic gadgets.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Alumina is one of the most commonly used and researched structural ceramic because of its excellent properties. However, its intrinsic brittleness is the fatal drawback, which hinders it from wider applications. How to improve its fracture toughness as well as the bending strength is always challenging for material researchers. In this paper, alumina matrix composites were fabricated by hot-pressing, in which some additives, including zirconia, alumina platelets, and MXene, were incorporated. The influence of the introduced additives on their microstructure and mechanical properties was investigated. Compare with the monolithic alumina, both bending strength and fracture toughness of all samples were improved greatly. Incorporation of zirconia was beneficial to the mechanical properties due to the phase-transformation strengthening and toughening mechanism. While alumina platelets resulted in high fracture toughness because of the self-toughening of elongated grains. The synergistic effect of alumina platelets and MXene enormously improved the fracture toughness from 2.9 ± 0.3 MPa·m1/2 for monolithic alumina to 7.5 ± 0.4 MPa·m1/2 for the composite, which was increased by 159%. This work will provide useful references for the fabrication of high-strength and high-toughness alumina ceramics by introducing additives properly.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Two-dimensional materials have been demonstrated as promising toolboxes for optoelectronics. Transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes), members of an emerging family of two-dimensional materials, have drawn extensive attention in optoelectronics owing to their excellent conductivity and tunable electronic properties. Herein, a photodetector based on the two-dimensional van der Waals heterostructure of Ti3C2Tx MXene and a MoS2 monolayer was constructed to observe the ambipolar photoresponse, which showed a positive photoresponse in the visible spectrum (500–700 nm) and a negative photoresponse at longer wavelengths (700–800 nm). The device exhibited a high negative responsivity of 1.9 A/W and a detectivity of 2.1 × 1010 Jones under 750 nm light illumination. Detailed experiments demonstrate that the negative photoresponse arises from the heterostructure-induced trap energy level, which confines the excited photoelectrons and leads to an inverse current. This work demonstrates a unique optoelectronic phenomenon in MoS2/MXene heterostructures and provides valuable insights into the development of new photodetection materials.',\n",

Here, a systematic study on the Raman spectra of 2D α-Mo2C (molybdenum carbide), a promising member in MXene family, is conducted. Six experimentally observed Raman modes from ultrathin α-Mo2C crystal are first assigned with the assistance of phonon dispersion calculated from density functional theory. Angle-resolved polarized Raman spectroscopy indicates the anisotropy of α-Mo2C in the b–c plane. Raman spectroscopy is further used to study the unique domain structures of 2D α-Mo2C crystals grown by chemical vapor deposition. A Raman mapping investigation suggests that most of the α-Mo2C flakes contain multiple domains and the c-axes of neighboring domains tend to form a 60° or 120° angle, due to the weak Mo\\uf8ffC bonds in this interstitial carbide and the low formation energy of the carbon chains along three equivalent directions. This study demonstrates that polarized Raman spectroscopy is a powerful and effective way to characterize the domain structures in α-Mo2C, which will facilitate the further exploration of the domain-structure-related properties and potential applications of α-Mo2C.',\n",

Primarily materials based on carbon nanostructures or polymer–carbon nanocomposites have been explored for this application. Herein, significantly enhanced THz shielding efficiencies for 2D titanium carbide (Ti3C2 MXene) thin films with nanoscale THz metamaterials are presented. Nanoscale slot antenna arrays with strong resonances at certain frequencies enhance THz electromagnetic waves up to three orders of magnitude in transmission, which in turn enormously increases the shielding performance in combination with MXene films. Drop-casting of a colloidal solution of MXene (a few micrograms of dry material) can produce an ultrathin film (several tens of nanometers in thickness) on a slot antenna array. Consequently, THz waves strongly localized in the near-field regime by the slot antenna undergo enhanced absorption through the film with a magnified effective refractive index. Finally, the combination of an ultrathin MXene film and a nano-metamaterial shows excellent shielding performance in the THz range.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\n\\nRecently, room-temperature stationary sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have received extensive investigations for large-scale energy storage systems (EESs) and smart grids due to the huge natural abundance and low cost of sodium. The SIBs share a similar “rocking-chair” sodium storage mechanism with lithium-ion batteries; thus, selecting appropriate electrodes with a low cost, satisfactory electrochemical performance, and high reliability is the key point for the development for SIBs. On the other hand, the carefully chosen elements in the electrodes also largely determine the cost of SIBs. Therefore, earth-abundant-metal-based compounds are ideal candidates for reducing the cost of electrodes. Among all the high-abundance and low-cost metal elements, cathodes containing iron and/or manganese are the most representative ones that have attracted numerous studies up till now. Herein, recent advances on both iron- and manganese-based cathodes of various types, such as polyanionic, layered oxide, MXene, and spinel, are highlighted. The structure–function property for the iron- and manganese-based compounds is summarized and analyzed in detail. With the participation of iron and manganese in sodium-based cathode materials, real applications of room-temperature SIBs in large-scale EESs will be greatly promoted and accelerated in the near future.',\n",

The rational integration of three categories of photothermal materials enables broadband light absorption, efficient light to heat conversion, low heat loss, rapid water transportation behavior, and much-improved corrosion and oxidation resistance. Moreover, when assembling with a hydrophobic insulating layer with hydrophilic channel, the MXene-based solar absorber can exhibit effective inhibition of salt crystallization due to the ability to advect and diffuse concentrated salt back into the water. As a result, when irradiating under one sun, the solar-vapor conversion efficiency of the MXene-based hierarchical design can achieve up to ≈93.4%, and can remain over 91% over 100 h to generate clean vapor for stable and continuous water desalination. This strategy opens an avenue for the development of MXene-based solar absorbers for sustainable solar-driven desalination.',\n",

Although great efforts have been devoted to achieve high-performance fibres over the past several years, it is still challenging for multifunctional macroscopic fibres to satisfy versatile applications. 2D transition metal carbides/nitrides (MXenes) with intriguing physical/chemical properties have been explored in broad application, and may be able to reinforce synthetic fibres. Inspired by natural materials, for the first time, flexible smart fibres and textiles are fabricated using a 3D printing process with hybrid inks of TEMPO (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxylradi-cal)-mediated oxidized cellulose nanofibrils (TOCNFs) and Ti3C2 MXene. The hybrid inks display good rheological properties, which allow them to achieve accurate structures and be rapidly printed. TOCNFs/Ti3C2 in hybrid inks self-assemble to fibres with an aligned structure in ethanol, mimicking the features of the natural structures of plant fibres. In contrast to conventional synthetic fibres with limited functions, smart TOCNFs/Ti3C2 fibres and textiles exhibit significant responsiveness to multiple external stimuli (electrical/photonic/mechanical). TOCNFs/Ti3C2 textiles with electromechanical performance can be processed into sensitive strain sensors. Such multifunctional smart fibres and textiles will be promising in diverse applications, including wearable heating textiles, human health monitoring, and human–machine interfaces.',\n",

Due to the abundant active groups on the surface, MXene is regarded as an ideal catalyst support. In this paper, the potential active sites of Ti3C2Tx (T=OH, F, O) for SF6 catalytic degradation were studied using DFT method. The results show the adsorption of SF6 on Ti3C2(OH)2 is significantly stronger than that on Ti3C2F2 and Ti3C2O2. Among typical adsorption sites on Ti3C2(OH)2, SF6 exhibited the strongest interaction at OH-1 site. Complex electron orbital interactions occurred between SF6 and Ti3C2(OH)2. The adsorption energy reached -6.739eV and about 1.414e transferred from Ti3C2(OH)2 to SF6. Structure of SF6 changed obviously and chemical adsorption occurred in this process. However, on Ti3C2F2 and Ti3C2O2, adsorption energy and electron transfer were small and the structure had little change, which was mainly physical adsorption. Compared with common catalysts such as Ag, α‑Al2O3 and BaTiO3, Ti3C2(OH)2 showed better catalytic activity for SF6 degradation. By strong adsorption of the active site on the surface, the degradation products were separated from each other, which weakened SF6 recombination and promoted the further degradation. The results provide theoretical support for MXene acting as a catalyst to efficiently degrade SF6.',\n",

Recently, two-dimensional MXenes and MXene-based nanomaterials have attracted increasing interest because of their unique properties (e.g., remarkable safety, a very large interlayer spacing, environmental flexibility, a large surface area, and thermal conductivity). In 2011, multilayered MXenes (Ti3C2Tx, a new family of two-dimensional (2D) materials) produced by etching an A layer from a MAX phase of Ti3AlC2, were first described by researchers at Drexel University. The term “MXene” was coined to distinguish this new family of 2D materials from graphene, and applies to both the original MAX phases and MXenes fabricated from them. We present a comprehensive review of recent studies on energy and environmental applications of MXene and MXene-based nanomaterials, including energy conversion and storage, adsorption, membrane, photocatalysis, and antimicrobial.

However, the practical use of lithium-sulfur batteries is still severely limited by the shuttle behavior and extremely slow sulfur redox kinetics. Herein, a dual-functional conductive 1T-MoSe2/MXene bidirectional catalyst as a high-efficiency sulfur host was constructed by few layers 1T-MoSe2 in-situ growth on MXene nano-flakes through one-step solvothermal reaction. Experiments and DFT theoretical analysis reveal that 1T-MoSe2/MXene possess a high electronic conductivity, strong adsorption ability and abundant active sites, which can provide the strong capture and catalytic conversion ability for LiPSs and uniform deposition of Li2S, thus effectively inhibiting the LiPSs shuttle behavior in lithium-sulfur batteries. Benefiting from the enhanced bidirectional sulfur redox kinetics and adsorption capacity, the S/1T-MoSe2/MXene cathode delivers a stable long cycling stability at 0.2 C after 500 cycles, which maintained at 784 mAh g-1 (average capacity fading rate per cycle of 0.07%). Furthermore, a high areal capacity of 6.9 mAh cm-2 was obtained at 0.1 C (after 200 cycles, maintained at 4.9 mAh cm-2 and capacity retention rate is ~73.1%).

       "  'abstract': 'Glucose is one of the most important monosaccharides found in the food, as a part of more complex structures, which is a primary energy source for the brain and body. Thus, the monitoring of glucose concentration is more important in food and biological samples in order to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Herein, an electrochemical glucose biosensor was fabricated by immobilization of glucose oxidase (GOX) onto poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):4-sulfocalix [4]arene (PEDOT:SCX)/MXene modified electrode. For this purpose, firstly, PEDOT was synthesized in the presence of SCX (counterion) by the chemical oxidative method. Secondly, MXene (a 2D layered material) was synthesized by using a high-temperature furnace under a nitrogen atmosphere. After that, PEDOT:SCX/MXene (1:1) dispersion was prepared by ultrasonication which was later utilized to prepare PEDOT:SCX/MXene hybrid film. A successful formation of PEDOT:SCX/MXene film was confirmed by HR-SEM, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), and Raman spectroscopies. Due to the biocompatibility nature, successful immobilization of GOX was carried out onto chitosan modified PEDOT:SCX/MXene/GCE. Moreover, the electrochemical properties of PEDOT:SCX/MXene/GOX/GCE was studied through cyclic voltammetry and amperometry methods. Interestingly, a stable redox peak of FAD-GOX was observed at a formal potential of –0.435 V on PEDOT:SCX/MXene/GOX/GCE which indicated a direct electron transfer between the enzyme and the electrode surface. PEDOT:SCX/MXene/GOX/GCE also exhibited a linear response against glucose concentrations in the linear range from 0.5 to 8 mM. The effect of pH, sensors reproducibility, and repeatability of the PEDOT:SCX/MXene/GOX/GCE sensor were studied. Finally, this new biosensor was successfully applied to detect glucose in commercial fruit juice sample with satisfactory recovery.',\n",

We first screen the support effect according to the stability of a single metal atom and find that Sc and Ti supported on Ti2CO2 have stronger adsorption energy than the cohesive energy of their bulk counterparts and therefore, we selected Sc and Ti supported on Ti2CO2 for further catalytic reactions. The stability and the potential catalytic reactivity are verified by electronic structure and charge transfer analysis. Both Eley–Rideal (ER) and Langmuir–Hinshelwood (LH) mechanisms are considered in this study, and lower energy barriers of 0.002 and 0.37\\u2005eV were found in the ER mechanism compared to the LH mechanism, which are 0.25 and 0.34\\u2005eV for Sc and Ti catalysts, respectively. Moreover, kinetic ER and LH mechanisms are favorable for both Sc- and Ti/Ti2CO2 because of the comparable energy barrier to other metals and SAC supported on 2D materials. However, Ti/Ti2CO2 catalyst is thermodynamically unfavorable. Based on these calculations, we propose that Sc supported on Ti2CO2 is the best catalyst for CO-oxidation. The current study not only broadens the scope of the single-atom Sc catalyst but also extends the consideration of MXene support for catalyst optimization.',\n",

By using solution-phase size-sorting followed by controlled surface oxidation process, a regulated distribution of MXene nanoflakes comprising metallic Ti3C2TX as the core surrounded by TiO2-a high dielectric constant insulator-as the shell is achieved. The size-sorted core/shell-like MXene nanoflakes show a self-sustainable charge trapping/detrapping behavior, which is highly feasible for realizing non-embed NFGs for transistor memory devices. Interestingly, unlike the conventional NFG-embedded architecture, the introduction of core/shell-like MXene under an electrolyte-gated graphene field-effect transistor (GFET) architecture induces a cooperative evolution of the hysteresis loop associated with ionic motion in the electrolyte gates and charge trapping/detrapping in the nanoflakes, resulting in a deterministic remote doping of the graphene layer. The resulting device exhibited a highly retentive memory behavior, which can be optimized by the nanoflake size distribution. In addition, synaptic functions having mechanical flexibility can be successfully emulated using MXene-based GFETs fabricated on a flexible polyethylene naphthalate substrate.',\n",

Recently, MXene as co-catalysts are considered promising green structured materials to replace expensive noble metals to promote both efficiency and photostability. The utilization of titanium carbide (Ti3C2Tx) MXene as a co-catalyst has shown great promise for assisting solar to hydrogen conversion owing to their structural flexibility, surface morphological, and tailorable termination groups. The surface functional groups, morphological developments and engineering aspects are important factors to optimize Ti3C2Tx as the best co-catalyst in solar energy applications. This review provides recent advances in morphological design of Ti3C2Tx MXene with critical analysis on the role of termination groups for promoting photoactivity and products selectivity. A deep focus is given to the engineering design of Ti3C2Tx MXene with special regard to quantum dots, monolayer, and hierarchical structures. Firstly, the general overview of Ti3C2Tx MXene is introduced with insights into their catalytic properties and formation of surface termination groups to gain profound understanding of their basic catalytic structure. Next, the effects of tailoring the morphology of Ti3C2Tx MXene into 2D accordion-like structure, monolayer, hierarchical, quantum dots, and nanotubes structure to expedite their role to promote solar-based photoactivity are critically discussed. In addition, specific considerations are given on the effects of reaction parameters, challenges, and synthesis strategies for tailoring the morphology of Ti3C2Tx MXene with controlled functional groups. Finally, future perspectives are provided for the potential use of Ti3C2Tx MXene as green materials in reaction engineering and environment applications.Graphical abstractDownload : Download high-res image (103KB)Download : Download full-size image',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Numerous compounds, ranging from clays to boron nitride (BN) and transition metal dichalcogenides, have been produced as 2D sheets. Although many of these materials remain subjects of purely academic interest, others have jumped into the limelight due to their attractive properties, which have led to practical applications. Among the latter are carbides and nitrides of transition metals known as MXenes (pronounced “maxenes”), a fast-growing family of 2D materials. The family of 2D transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes) has been expanding rapidly since the discovery of Ti3C2 at Drexel University in 2011 [1]. More than 30 different MXenes have been reported, and the structure and properties of numerous other MXenes have been predicted using density functional theory (DFT) calculations [2,3]. Moreover, the availability of solid solutions on M and X sites, control of surface terminations, and the discovery of ordered double-M MXenes (e.g., Mo2TiC2), i-MAX phases and their MXenes offer the potential for producing dozens of new distinct structures.\\n               This presentation will describe the state of the art in the field. The manufacturing of MXenes, their delamination into single-layer 2D flakes and assembly into films, fibers and 3D structures will be briefly covered. Synthesis-structure-properties relations of MXenes will be addressed on the example of Ti3C2. The use of MXenes in ceramic- metal- and polymer-matrix composites, smart fibers and textiles will also be discussed. The versatile chemistry of the MXene family renders their properties tunable for a large variety of applications [3-5]. Oxygen or hydroxyl-terminated MXenes, such as Ti3C2O2, have been shown to have redox capable transition metals layers on the surface and offer a combination of high electronic conductivity with hydrophilicity, as well as fast ionic transport [4]. This, among many other advantageous properties, makes the material family promising candidates for energy storage and related electrochemical applications [4], but applications in plasmonics, electrocatalysis, biosensors, water purification/ desalination and other fields are equally exciting.\\n               References \\n               1.

       "  'abstract': 'Electrochemical energy storage (EES) and conversion devices (e.g. batteries, supercapacitors, and reactors) are emerging as primary methods for global efforts to shift energy dependence from limited fossil fuels towards sustainable and renewable resources. These electric-based devices, while showing great potential for meeting some key metrics set by conventional technologies still face significant limitations. For example, an EES device tends to exhibit large energy density (e.g. lithium-ion battery) or power density (e.g. supercapacitor), but not both. This inability of a single device to simultaneously achieve both metrics represents a major obstacle to widespread adoption of EES devices. Improvements in materials, such as the integration of 2D materials (e.g. graphene, dichalcogenides, MXene, etc.) into electrochemical devices has yielded some exciting results towards tackling this issue, but significant improvements are still needed. Our approach to simultaneously achieving high energy and power density is to focus on one of the fundamental processes that occur in these systems: mass (or charge) transport. The efficient transport of ions within EES devices is critical to realizing both large power and energy densities. The pore structure of the electrode is a key factor in determining this transport phenomena, but in many cases, engineering the pore structure in a highly deterministic fashion is not pursued or even possible for many electrode materials. In this work, we explore a number of additive manufacturing methods (e.g. direct ink write, projection microstereolithography, etc.) to engineer the pore structure of device electrodes. We also determine effective electrode geometries using both simple theory and topology optimization techniques. The topology optimization couples the solution of the forward electrochemical problem over the full electrode domain with gradient-based optimization. The output of our code is a three-dimensional CAD representation which optimizes over specific performance metrics and which can be used to print functional electrodes. This work provides a systematic path toward automatic design and fabrication of engineered electrodes with precise control over the fluid and species distribution.\\n               This work was performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344.',\n",

Herein, we report electronically coupled metallic hybrids of NiFe layered double hydroxide nanosheet/Ti3C2 MXene quantum dots deposited on a nitrogen-doped graphene surface (LDH/MQD/NG) for high-performance flexible Zn–air batteries (ZABs). As verified from the Mott–Schottky and Nyquist plots, as well as spectroscopic, electrochemical, and computational analyses, the electronic and chemical coupling of LDH/MQD/NG modulates the local electronic and surface structure of the active LDH to provide metallic conductivity and abundant active sites, leading to significantly improved bifunctional activity and electrocatalytic kinetics. The rechargeable ZABs with LDH/MQD/NG hybrids are superior to the previous LDH-based ZABs, demonstrating a high power density (113.8\\xa0mW\\u2009cm−2) and excellent cycle stability (150\\u2009h at 5\\xa0mA\\u2009cm−2). Moreover, the corresponding quasi solid-state ZABs are completely flexible and practical, affording a high power density of 57.6\\xa0mW\\u2009cm−2 even in the bent state, and in real-life operation of tandem cells for powering various electronic devices.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Wound healing is a complex physiological process that involves coordinated phases such as inflammation and neovascularization. Attempts to promote the healing process tend to construct an effective delivery system based on different drugs and materials. In this paper, we propose novel MXene-integrated microneedle patches with adenosine encapsulation for wound healing. Owing to the dynamic covalent bonding capacity of boronate molecules with adenosine, 3-(acrylamido)phenylboronic acid- (PBA-) integrated polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA) hydrogel is utilized as the host material of microneedle patches. Benefitting from photothermal conversion capacity of MXene, the release of loaded adenosine could be accelerated under NIR irradiation for maintaining the activation signal around injury site. In vitro cell experiments proved the effect of MXene-integrated microneedle patches with adenosine encapsulation in enhancing angiogenesis. When applied for treating animal models, it is demonstrated that the microneedle patches efficiently promote angiogenesis, which is conductive to wound healing. These features make the proposed microneedle patch potential for finding applications in wound healing and other biomedical fields.',\n",

The devices are composed of a battery anode and a supercapacitor cathode, and thus become a tradeoff between batteries and supercapacitors. In the past two decades, tremendous efforts have been put into the search for suitable electrode materials to overcome the kinetic imbalance between the battery-type anode and the capacitor-type cathode. Recently, some transition-metal compounds have been found to show pseudocapacitive characteristics in a nonaqueous electrolyte, which makes them interesting high-rate candidates for hybrid MIC anodes. Here, the material design strategies in Li-ion and Na-ion capacitors are summarized, with a focus on pseudocapacitive oxide anodes (Nb2O5, MoO3, etc.), which provide a new opportunity to obtain a higher power density of the hybrid devices. The application of Mxene as an anode material of MICs is also discussed. A perspective to the future research of MICs toward practical applications is proposed to close.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\n\\nAlthough Ti3C2 MXene has shown great potential in energy storage field, poor conductivity and restacking between MXene flakes seriously hinders the maximization of its capacitance. Herein, a new strategy to solve the problems is developed. Gallery Al atoms in Ti3AlC2 are partially removed by simple hydrothermal etching to get Ti3C2Tx reserving appropriate Al interlayers (Ti3C2Tx@Al). Ti3C2Tx@Al keeps stable layered structure rather than isolated Ti3C2Tx flakes, which avoids flake restacking. The removal of partial Al frees up space for easy electrolyte infiltration while the reserved Al as “electron bridges” ensures high interlayer conductivity. As a result, the areal capacitance reaches up to 1087 mF cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2 and over 95% capacitance is maintained after 6000 cycles. The all-solid-state supercapacitor (ASSS) based on Ti3C2Tx@Al delivers a high capacitance of 242.3 mF cm−2 at 1 mV s−1 and exhibits stable performance at different bending states. Two ASSSs in tandem can light up a light-emitting diode under the planar or wrapping around an arm. The established strategy provides a new avenue to improve capacitance performances of MXenes.',\n",

First, the interlaced layered MnO2 is grown on the interlayer and surface of MXene through the hydrothermal reaction. And then the composite was covered with conducting polymer PANI through the redox reaction in the ice bath to obtain the ternary MXene/MnO2/PANI nanostructure. The accordion-like MXene substrate has good conductivity and provides electron conduction channels. MnO2 nanosheets not only inhibit the re-stacking of the MXene layer but also form an effective pore space, which is conducive to ion diffusion and transfer. The outer PANI can further improve the electrochemical performance of the composite. The morphology, chemical structure, and crystal phase of the prepared nanostructure were measured in detail by SEM, FTIR, and XRD. In addition, the behavior of the supercapacitor was analyzed through cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge and discharge (GCD) tests. Test analyses show that the specific capacitance of the MXene/MnO2/PANI nanostructure is about 216 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1.

In this study, a straightforward mathematical method is proposed for extracting and deconvoluting the real-time fluxes and ionic currents of two species based on the EQCM measurement results. We creatively propose the concept of flux cyclic voltammograms (CVs) and ionic current CVs of various species and apply them to the real-time analyses of molecules/ions dynamics. For proof of concept, Ti3C2Tx MXene, a most studied two-dimensional metal carbide, is investigated as a supercapacitor electrode in a 1M H2SO4 electrolyte. The H2O and H+ flux CV plots are highly symmetrical, indicating reversible inserting/deserting species fluxes. The highest fluxes along with maximum hydration numbers are obtained at the peak current potential. This suggests the significant contribution of double-layer capacitance originates from the insertion of hydrated H+. The H+ CV with the ionic current induced by H+ flux overlaps the real CV, confirming that H+ is the only interactive ion for screening the electrode charge. Lastly, we also validate the proposed strategy using Ti3C2Tx MXene electrode in 1M KCl electrolyte and YP80 porous carbon electrode in 1 M LiCl electrolyte.',\n",

In this work, the intrinsic lattice thermal conductivity of monolayer MoSi2N4 is predicted by solving the phonon Boltzmann transport equation based on the first-principles calculations. Despite the heavy atomic mass of Mo and complex crystal structure, the monolayer MoSi2N4 unexpectedly exhibits a quite high lattice thermal conductivity over a wide temperature range between 300 to 800\\xa0K. At 300\\xa0K, its in-plane lattice thermal conductivity is 224 Wm−1\\xa0K−1. The detailed analysis indicates that the large group velocities and small anharmonicity are the main reasons for its high lattice thermal conductivity. We also calculate the lattice thermal conductivity of monolayer WSi2N4, which is only a little smaller than that of MoSi2N4. Our findings suggest that monolayer MoSi2N4 and WSi2N4 are potential 2D materials for thermal transport in future nano-electronic devices.',\n",

Here, we reported an electrostatic assembly approach for fabricating 2D/1D/0D construction of Ti3C2Tx/carbon nanotubes/Co nanoparticles (Ti3C2Tx/CNTs/Co) nanocomposites with an excellent electromagnetic wave absorption, EMI shielding efficiency, flexibility, hydrophobicity, and photothermal conversion performance. As expected, a strong reflection loss of -85.8\\xa0dB and an ultrathin thickness of 1.4\\xa0mm were achieved. Meanwhile, the high EMI shielding efficiency reached 110.1\\xa0dB. The excellent electromagnetic wave absorption and shielding performances were originated from the charge carriers, electric/magnetic dipole polarization, interfacial polarization, natural resonance, and multiple internal reflections. Moreover, a thin layer of polydimethylsiloxane rendered the hydrophilic hierarchical Ti3C2Tx/CNTs/Co hydrophobic, which can prevent the degradation/oxidation of the MXene in high humidity condition. Interestingly, the Ti3C2Tx/CNTs/Co film exhibited a remarkable photothermal conversion performance with high thermal cycle stability and tenability. Thus, the multifunctional Ti3C2Tx/CNTs/Co nanocomposites possessing a unique blend of outstanding electromagnetic wave absorption and EMI shielding, light-driven heating performance, and flexible water-resistant features were highly promising for the next-generation intelligent electromagnetic attenuation system.\\nAbstractSection\\n                Highlights\\n                \\n                  \\n\\nThe 2D/1D/0D Ti3C2Tx/carbon nanotubes/Co nanocomposite is successfully synthesized via an electrostatic assembly.\\n\\n\\nNanocomposites exhibit an excellent electromagnetic wave absorption and a remarkable electromagnetic interference shielding efficiency.\\n\\n\\nThe flexible, waterproof, and photothermal conversion performances are achieved.',\n",

Thermal imaging confirms that these structures are capable of extraordinary heating rates (as high as 303\\u2009K/s) that are frequency- and concentration-dependent. At high loading (and high conductivity), Ti3C2Tx MXene composites do not heat under RF fields due to reflection of electromagnetic waves, whereas composites with low conductivity do not heat due to the lack of an electrical percolating network. Composites with an intermediate loading and a conductivity between 10–1000\\u2009S\\u2009m−1 rapidly generate heat under RF fields.

Understanding of adhesion between MXenes and various substrates is critically important for MXene device fabrication and performance. We report results of direct atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements of adhesion of two MXenes (Ti3C2Tx and Ti2CTx) with a SiO2 coated Si spherical tip. The Maugis-Dugdale theory was applied to convert the AFM measured adhesion force to adhesion energy, while taking into account surface roughness. The obtained adhesion energies were compared with those for mono-, bi-, and tri-layer graphene, as well as SiO2 substrates. The average adhesion energies for the MXenes are 0.90\\u2009±\\u20090.03\\u2009J\\u2009m−2 and 0.40\\u2009±\\u20090.02\\u2009J\\u2009m−2 for thicker Ti3C2Tx and thinner Ti2CTx, respectively, which is of the same order of magnitude as that between graphene and silica tip. The adhesion of two-dimensional transition metal carbides (MXenes) is important for potential MXene device fabrication and performance. Here, the authors show that adhesion of MXenes depends on their monolayer thickness and, in contrast to graphene, does not show number-of-monolayers dependency.',\n",

Here, inspired by nature, a 3D honeycomb-like fabric decorated with hydrophilic Ti3C2Tx (MXene) is innovatively designed and successfully woven as solar evaporator. The honeycomb structure with periodically concave arrays creates the maximum level of light-trapping by multiple scattering and omnidirectional light absorption, synergistically cooperating with light absorbance of MXene. The minimum thermal loss is available by constructing the localized photothermal generation, contributed by a thermal-insulating barrier connected with 1D water path, and the concave structure of efficiently recycling convective and radiative heat loss. The evaporator demonstrates high solar efficiency of up to 93.5% and evaporation rate of 1.62\\xa0kg\\xa0m−2\\xa0h−1 under one sun irradiation. Moreover, assisted by a 1D water path in the center, the salt solution transporting in the evaporator generates a radial concentration gradient from the center to the edge so that the salt is crystallized at the edge even in 21% brine, enabling the complete separation of water/solute and efficient salt harvesting. This research provides a large-scale manufacturing route of high-performance solar steam generator.',\n",

Under simulated sunlight irradiation of 1 sun, a high efficiency evaporation performance could be maintained after 50 cycles. In addition, JPP@M could be used to effectively reduce the viscosity of heavy crude oil through solar-assisted heating, resulting in effective purification. Moreover, JPP@M exhibited excellent antibacterial property, which is more important for biomass samples.

Conventional electrocatalysts based on precious metals are rare and very-expensive for large-scale production of hydrogen, demanding the exploration for low-cost earth abundant alternatives. In this context, extensive works from both theoretical and experimental investigations have shown that two-dimensional (2D) layered materials have gained considerable attention as highly effective electrocatalytic materials for electrical-driven hydrogen production because of their unique layered structure and exciting electrical properties. This review highlights recent advancements on 2D layered materials, including graphene, transitional metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), layered double hydroxides (LDHs), MXene, and graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) as cost-effective and highly efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen production. In addition, some fundamental aspects of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) process and a wide ranging overview on several strategies to design and synthesize 2D layered material as HER electrocatalysts for commercial applications are introduced. Finally, the conclusion and futuristic prospects and challenges of the advancement of 2D layered materials as non-precious HER electrocatalysts are briefly discussed.',\n",

The present investigation deals with the fabrication of nanocomposite Fe3O4@MXene membranes by self-assembly of Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) and two-dimensional (2D) MXene nanosheets on the surface of cellulose acetate (CA) base membrane. The Fe3O4 NPs were found to be uniformly dispersed on the MXene sheet structure and thus expanded the 2D nanochannel of MXene. The water flux and the removal ratio of heavy metal ions by this nanocomposite membrane were found to improve significantly, compared to the virgin MXene membrane. Under the synergistic effect of layer sieving and the adsorption ability, the composite NF membrane was found to achieve a maximum of 63.2% for Cu2+, 64.1% for Cd2+ and 70.2% for Cr6+ removal from wastewater, respectively. Moreover, Fe3O4@MXene membrane also exhibited good recycling ability after washing by HCl solution.',\n",

First, we give an overview of the status of this new field providing a summary of where MXenes have been studied both experimentally and theoretically as catalyst materials as well as where discovery has benefited from a combined computational-experimental approach. We exemplify the combined computational-experimental approach and the crucial impact of a feedback loop between the two by using the hydrogen evolution reaction. When it comes to modeling, we describe how we can use high-throughput computational screening approaches to calculate reactivity and activity properties based on fundamental insight and understanding established prior to the screening process which in turn can be used to identify MXene candidate materials for specific chemical transformations.

However, MXene usually undergoes serious face-to-face restacking and inferior stability, significantly preventing its further commercial application. Herein, to suppress the oxidation and self-restacking of MXene, an efficient and fast self-assembly route to prepare a 3D porous oxidation-resistant MXene/graphene (PMG) composite with the assistance of an in situ sacrificial metallic zinc template is demonstrated. The self-assembled 3D\\xa0porous architecture can effectively prevent the oxidation of MXene layers with no evident variation in electrical conductivity in air at room temperature after two months, guaranteeing outstanding electrical conductivity and abundant electrochemical active sites accessible to electrolyte ions. Consequently, the PMG-5 electrode possesses a striking specific capacitance of 393\\xa0F\\xa0g−1, superb rate performance (32.7% at 10\\xa0V\\xa0s−1), and outstanding cycling stability. Furthermore, the as-assembled asymmetric supercapacitor possesses a pronounced energy density of 50.8\\xa0Wh\\xa0kg−1 and remarkable cycling stability with a 4.3% deterioration of specific capacitance after 10\\xa0000 cycles.

       "  'abstract': 'Confinement plays an important role in determining ion transport in porous materials, which, in turn, may influence the performance of many energy storage and desalination devices. In this work, we combined density functional theory (DFT) with an implicit solvation model and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) to investigate the effects of nanoconfinement on several solvated alkaline metal cations in a single-digit 1T-MoS2 nanochannel. Our DFT calculations with a solvation model indicated that cations with stronger hydration energy introduce a higher number of co-intercalated water molecules into the channel, consistent with early experimental observation obtained for MXene (2D transition metal carbide) channels. The predicted optimal water numbers for the cations were then used for AIMD simulations that explicitly include the effects of the solvent. When compared with the cations in bulk solution, our simulations showed that the hydration structure and coordination number (CN) of the solvated cations confined in the MoS2 channel can be significantly altered. We found that larger cations with weaker hydration energy (K+, Rb+, and Cs+) exhibited a distinctive CN decrease under confinement, while smaller cations (Li+ and Na+) retained a similar hydration shell as in the bulk solution. More specifically, the hydration shell of large cations (K+, Rb+, and Cs+) in MoS2 showed similar features of the coordination angle to the bulk, which suggests the partially broken hydration shell with no geometry change under confinement. Our simulations provided insights into the change of the hydration structure of alkaline metal cations under confinement, which may have important implications on their transport in the 1T-MoS2 channel.',\n",

The adsorption energy and Gibbs free energy were calculated to describe the limiting potentials of N2 activation and reduction, respectively. N2 activation was spontaneous, and the reduction potential-limiting step may be the hydrogenation of N2 to *NNH and the desorption of *NH3 to NH3. The charge transfer of the adsorbed Fe atoms to N2 molecules weakened the interaction of N≡N, which indicates that Fe/MXene is a potential catalytic material for the NRR. In particular, doping with nonmetals F and S reduced the limiting potential of the two potential-limiting steps in the reduction reaction, compared with the undoped pure structure.

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\n\\nElectrical control of atom-thick van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnets is a key toward future magnetoelectric nanodevices; however, state-of-the-art control approaches are volatile. In this work, introducing ferroelectric switching as an aided layer is demonstrated to be an effective approach toward achieving nonvolatile electrical control of 2D ferromagnets. For example, when a ferromagnetic monolayer CrI3 and ferroelectric MXene Sc2CO2 come together into multiferroic heterostructures, CrI3 is controlled by polarized states P↑ and P↓ of Sc2CO2. P↑ Sc2CO2 does not change the semiconducting nature of CrI3, but surprisingly P↓ Sc2CO2 makes CrI3 half-metallic. Nonvolatility of the electrical switching between two oppositely ferroelectric polarized states, therefore, indirectly enables nonvolatile electrical control of CrI3 between ferromagnetic semiconductor and half-metal. The heterointerface-induced half-metallicity in CrI3 is intrinsic without resorting to any chemical functionalization or external physical modification, which is rather beneficial to the practical application. This work paves the way for nonvolatile electrical control of 2D vdW ferromagnets and applications of CrI3 in half-metal-based nanospintronics.',\n",

The calculations are carried out using the computational software package QUANTUM-ESPRESSO/PWSCF based on density functional theory (DFT) and the pseudopotential method. The calculated lattice parameters a and c are in good agreement with the previous theoretical and experimental studies. Structural calculations described that Y4C3 is more stable than Y3C2 and Y2C. Analyzing cohesive energy indicates that the structural stability of these compounds increases with increasing n-index due to the increase in the number of stronger bonds between Y and C atoms in the thicker MXene monolayers. The phonon dispersion calculations show that the Yn+1Cn MXenes are dynamically stable at ambient pressure, and it is possible to be experimentally synthesized.Based on the electronic results, it can be argued that the Yn+1Cn has a metallic behavior in the hexagonal structure. Also, the electron charge density distribution confirms the metallic behavior of Yn+1Cn structures. The thermodynamic calculations indicate that enthalpy increases continuously and steadily by increasing pressure and n-index in the Yn+1Cn structures. Generally, for Yn+1Cn (n\\xa0=\\xa01, 2, and 3) MXenes with the increasing n-index, Debye temperature and stiffness decrease, followed by heat capacity increases.Graphical abstractDownload : Download high-res image (84KB)Download : Download full-size image',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\n\\nElectric power system applications demand for high-temperature dielectric materials. The improved performance of polymer nanocomposites requires improvement in their thermal conductivity & stability, dielectric stability and processing technique. However, they often lose their dielectric properties with a rise in temperature. Here, we offer a solution by incorporating electrically conducting material (MXene) and semiconducting inorganic nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) into an insulating PMMA polymer matrix to maintain high dielectric constant, both at the room and high temperature. Therefore, to achieve desirable thermal and dielectric properties is the main objective of the present study based on the homogeneous distribution of the nanofillers by in-situ bulk polymerization assisted by strong sonication in the corresponding polymer. The introduction of MXene and ZnO NPs into the PMMA not only acquires a substantial increment in the dielectric constant, to attain a value 437, with minimum energy loss of 0.36 at 25\\u2009Hz, but also improves the thermal conductivity of PMMA up to 14 times by causing the reduction of thermal resistance, which is actually responsible for the poor thermal conductivity of amorphous pure PMMA polymer. More importantly, hybrid PMMA/4:2 wt% MXene:ZnO nanocomposite leads to an excellent thermal stability. Moreover, further characterization of the synthesized nanocomposites by FTIR, SEM and XRD leads to the evaluation of strong interaction of ternary components with PMMA matrix.',\n",

Several studies have focused on imitating tactile perception closer to natural skin, however, there remains a great challenge in developing a complete artificial tactile sensory system with high sensitivity over a broad pressure range. Herein, a highly sensitive hybridized nanofibrous membrane-based pressure sensor is newly proposed to overcome the limitation of the existing piezoresistive pressure sensor by improving the sensitivity and working range. As a primary sensing material, polyaniline (PANI)-nanospines are uniformly deposited throughout the hybrid hierarchical nanofibers to achieve a high sensitivity (179.1 kPa−1) with a low detection limit (1.2\\xa0Pa). Additionally, the highly deformable hierarchical nanofibrous membranes enables linear response over a broad pressure range (0\\xa0− 50 kPa) with a high durability (10,000 cycles). These results indicate that the fabricated pressure sensor has a broad application perspective, particularly in e-skins and wearable electronic devices.Graphical AbstractA highly sensitive hybrid nanofibrous membrane was fabricated for use in e-skin applications. The internal structure of the fiber consists of cellulose and MXene, which add strength and conductivity to the polymer backbone. The polyaniline-nanospines morphology, deposited uniformly on a hierarchical nanofibrous membrane, provides enhanced contact area that results in high pressure sensitivity and linearity.Download : Download high-res image (247KB)Download : Download full-size image',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Clean water supply in off-grid locations remains a stumbling stone for socio-economic development in remote areas where solar energy is abundant. In this regard, several technologies have already introduced various solutions to the off-grid freshwater predicament; however, most of them are either costly or complex to operate. Nonetheless, photothermal membrane distillation (PMD) has emerged as a promising candidate with great potential to be autonomously driven by solar energy. Instead of using energy-intensive bulk feed heating in conventional MD systems, PMD membranes can directly harvest the incident solar light at the membrane interface as an alternative driving energy resource for the desalination process. Because of its excellent photothermal properties and stability in ionic environments, herein, Ti3C2Tx MXene was coated onto commercial polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membranes to allow for a self-heated PMD process. An average water vapor flux of 0.77 kg/m2 h with an excellent temporal response under intermitting lighting and a photothermal efficiency of 65.3% were achieved by the PMD membrane under one-sun irradiation for a feed salinity of 0.36 g/L. Naturally, the efficiency of the process decreased with higher feed concentrations due to the reduction of the evaporation rate and the scattering of incident sunlight toward the membrane photothermal surface, especially at rates above 10 g/L. Notably, with such performance, 1 m2 of the MXene-coated PMD membrane can fulfill the recommended daily potable water intake for a household, that is, ca. 6 L/day.',\n",

Here, not only 2D α-Mo2C but also 2D β-Mo2C crystal sheets with distinct disordered carbon distributions were successfully grown. 2D β-Mo2C shows a much stronger superconductivity than 2D α-Mo2C, and their superconductivities have different hydrostatic pressure responses. The superconducting transition temperature Tc of 2D α-Mo2C shows a dome-shaped profile under pressure, implying the existence of two competing effects arising from phononic and electronic properties, while for 2D β-Mo2C, Tc decreases monotonically with increasing pressure, possibly due to phonon stiffening. These results indicate that the electronic properties have a more important influence on the superconductivity in 2D α-Mo2C compared to 2D β-Mo2C. The ordered and disordered carbon distributions in 2D α-Mo2C and β-Mo2C, respectively, may be the underlying origin for their different electronic and superconducting properties.',\n",

However, further research is required to harness EGaIn-composites advantages and address their application as a biomedical scaffold. In this research, EGaIn-polylactic acid/polycaprolactone composites with and without a second conductive filler, MXene, were prepared and characterized. The addition of MXene, into the EGaIn-composite, can improve the composite's electrochemical properties by connecting the liquid metal droplets resulting in electrically conductive continuous pathways within the polymeric matrix. The results showed that the composite with 50% EGaIn and 4% MXene, displayed optimal electrochemical properties and enhanced mechanical and radiopacity properties. Furthermore, the composite showed good biocompatibility, examined through interactions with fibroblast cells, and antibacterial properties against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Therefore, the liquid metal (EGaIn) polymer composite with MXene provides a first proof-of-concept engineering scaffold strategy with low toxicity, functional electrochemical properties, and promising antimicrobial properties.\",\n",

Herein, we propose a braided coaxial zinc-ion hybrid FSC with several meters of Ti3C2Tx MXene cathode as core electrodes, and shell zinc fiber anode was braided on the surface of the Ti3C2Tx MXene fibers across the solid electrolytes. According to the simulated results using ANSYS Maxwell software, the braided structures revealed a higher capacitance compared to the spring-like structures. The resulting FSCs exhibited a high areal capacitance of 214 mF cm–2, the energy density of 42.8 μWh cm−2 at 5\\xa0mV\\xa0s−1, and excellent cycling stability with 83.58% capacity retention after 5000 cycles. The coaxial FSC was tied several kinds of knots, proving a shape-controllable fiber energy storage. Furthermore, the knitted FSC showed superior stability and weavability, which can be woven into watch belts or embedded into textiles to power smart watches and LED arrays for a few days.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'As a layered material, Ti3C2Tx powders possess high ion-exchange capability and relative stable physical properties, but there are some drawbacks associated with Ti3C2Tx powders such as weak adsorption ability in dealing with the organic pollutions and heavy metal ions. A simple method is employed to regulate Ti3C2Tx powders with the silane coupling agent KH570, which is proved to be an efficient way for adsorption to Pb(II). In this work, Ti3C2Tx powders with the modification of KH570 (Ti3C2Tx-KH570) possesses high specific surface area, thermostability and high ion-exchange capability. From the experiment of adsorption, when the concentration of Ti3C2Tx-KH570 powders in the solution is about 3.2\\xa0g\\xa0L−1, the removal rate is about 99.99%. In addition, the adsorption capacity of Ti3C2Tx-KH570 powders to Pb2+ is approximately 147.29\\xa0mg\\xa0g−1 at the temperature of 30\\xa0°C, while the adsorption capability of Ti3C2Tx powders to Pb2+ is 48.28\\xa0mg\\xa0g−1. A higher concentration of silane clogs, the available space making it inaccessible for lead adsorption, which indicates that the internal MXene hydroxyl groups are in the majority responsible for Pb2+ adsorption. The Pb2+ adsorption depends on the availability of MXene hydroxyl groups and KH570 carbonyl group of methacryloxypropyl chain. The result indicates that KH570 is a new direction for the surface modification of Ti3C2Tx powders.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Although various two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials have been explored as promising capacitive materials due to their unique layered structure, their natural restacking tendency impedes electrolyte transport and significantly restricts their practical applications. Herein, we synthesize all-carbon layer-by-layer motif architectures by introducing 2D ordered mesoporous carbons (OMC) within the interlayer space of 2D nanomaterials. As a proof of concept, MXenes are selected as 2D hosts to design 2D–2D heterostructures. Further removing the metal elements from MXenes leads to the formation of all-carbon 2D–2D heterostructures consisting of alternating layers of MXene-derived carbon (MDC) and OMC. The OMC layers intercalated with the MDC layers not only prevent restacking but also facilitate ion diffusion and electron transfer. The performance of the obtained hybrid carbons as supercapacitor electrodes demonstrates their potential for upcoming electronic devices. This method allows to overcome the restacking and blocking of 2D nanomaterials by constructing ion-accessible OMC within the 2D host material. 2D nanomaterials are promising capacitive energy storage materials, but their tendency to restack hinders electrolyte transport. Here, Yamauchi and colleagues introduce 2D ordered mesoporous carbons in between MXene layers, and metal removal affords all-carbon porous 2D–2D heterostructures in which restacking is prevented.',\n",

However, the low capacity of MXene electrodes limits their further application in ECs. Herein, with excellent electrochemical performance of MnO2, Ti3C2 nanosheets decorated with MnO2 nanoparticles were synthesized through a simple liquid phase precipitation method and heat treatment process, and were subsequently employed to the electrode for ECs. TEM and XRD results demonstrate that MnO2 nanoparticles, about 20–40\\xa0nm in diameter size, have been homogeneously inserted into the interlamination of Ti3C2 matrix for cation intercalation.

MXenes 2D flakes have n + 1 (n = 1 – 4) atomic layers of transition metals interleaved by carbon/nitrogen layers, but to-date remain limited in composition to one or two transition metals. In this study, through the use of four transition metals, we report the synthesis of multi-principal element high-entropy M4C3Tx MXenes. Specifically, we introduce two high-entropy MXenes, TiVNbMoC3Tx and TiVCrMoC3Tx, as well as their precursor TiVNbMoAlC3 and TiVCrMoAlC3 high-entropy MAX phases. We used a combination of real and reciprocal space characterization (x-ray diffraction, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, and scanning transmission electron microscopy) to establish the structure, phase purity, and equimolar distribution of the four transition metals in high-entropy MAX and MXene phases. We use first-principles calculations to compute the formation energies and explore synthesizability of these high-entropy MAX phases. We also show that when three transition metals are used instead of four, under similar synthesis conditions to those of the four-element MAX phase, two different MAX phases can be formed (i.e. no pure single-phase forms). This finding indicates the importance of configurational entropy in stabilizing the desired single-phase high-entropy MAX over multiphases of MAX, which is essential for the synthesis of phase-pure high-entropy MXenes. The synthesis of high-entropy MXenes significantly expand the compositional variety of the MXene family to further tune their properties, including electronic, magnetic, electrochemical, catalytic, high temperature stability, and mechanical properties.',\n",

MXenes are obtained by removing the A element from precursor MAX phases, and it is for this reason that it is often assumed that the resulting 2D material displays the MAX atomic layer stacking---an ABC sequence with trigonal $({D}_{3d})$ symmetry. By means of density functional theory calculations, including dispersion, this work thoroughly explores the stability of alternative ABA stacking, with ${D}_{3h}$ hexagonal symmetry, for a total of 54 MXene materials with ${\\\\mathrm{M}}_{2}\\\\mathrm{X}, {\\\\mathrm{M}}_{3}{\\\\mathrm{X}}_{2}$, and ${\\\\mathrm{M}}_{4}{\\\\mathrm{X}}_{3}$ stoichiometries ($\\\\mathrm{M}=\\\\mathrm{Ti}$, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, or W; and $\\\\mathrm{X}=\\\\mathrm{C}$ or N), revealing that for clean MXenes, the ABA stacking is fostered (i) by the number of $d$ electrons in M, (ii) when $\\\\mathrm{X}=\\\\mathrm{N}$ rather than $\\\\mathrm{X}=\\\\mathrm{C}$, and (iii) when the surface is terminated by oxygen adatoms. The results suggest that stacking phase transitions are likely to take place under working operando conditions, surmounting affordable layer sliding energy barriers, in accordance with the experimentally observed layer distortions in $\\\\mathrm{M}{\\\\mathrm{o}}_{2}\\\\mathrm{N}$. Finally, we tackled the adsorptive and catalytic capabilities implications of such layer phase transition by considering ${\\\\mathrm{N}}_{2}$ adsorption, dissociation, and hydrogenation on selected ABC and ABA stacked MXenes. Results highlight changes in adsorption energies of up to \\\\ensuremath{\\\\sim}1 eV, and in ${\\\\mathrm{N}}_{2}$ dissociation energy barriers of up to \\\\ensuremath{\\\\sim}0.3 eV, which can critically change the reaction step rate constant by three to four orders of magnitude for working temperatures in the 400--700 K range. Consequently, it is mandatory to carefully determine the atomic structure of MXenes and to use models with the most stable stacking when inspecting their chemical or physical properties.',\n",

The produced hybrid materials can be used as substrates for surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). An approximate analytical approach is also developed for the calculation of the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) frequency of nanoparticles immersed in a medium, near the interface of two dielectric media with different dielectric constants. We obtained a good match with the experimental data for SPR wavelengths, 440\\u2009nm and 558\\u2009nm, respectively for silver and gold nanoparticles. In the case of palladium, our calculated SPR wavelength for the planar geometry was 160\\u2009nm, demonstrating that non-spherical palladium nanoparticles coupled with 2D MXene yield a broad, significanlty red-shifted SPR band with a peak at 230\\u2009nm. We propose a possible mechanism of the plasmonic hybridization of nanoparticles with MXene. The as-prepared noble metal nanoparticles on MXene show a highly sensitive SERS detection of methylene blue (MB) with calculated enhancement factors on the order of 105.

       "  'abstract': 'The fast and reversible sodiation/desodiation of anode materials remains an indelible yet fascinating target. Herein, a class of the densely packed Si/MXene composite microspheres is constructed and prepared, taking advantages of the synergistic effects of the activated Si nanoparticles and conductive flower-like MXene microspheres with ample ion-diffusion pathways. Consequently, the intrinsic MXene nanosheets with intelligently regulated interlayer spacing can accommodate the volume change induced strain during cycling, and the strong interaction between the Si and MXene matrix greatly contributes to the robust structural stability. As expected, the Si/MXene composite architecture exhibits boosted sodium storage performance, in terms of an inspiring reversible capacity of 751\\xa0mAh·g−1 at 0.1\\xa0A·g−1, remarkable long-term cycling stability of 376\\xa0mAh·g−1 at 0.1\\xa0A·g−1 over 500 cycles, and outstanding rate capability (after one consecutive current density changing from 0.1 to 2.0\\xa0A·g−1, a large capacity of 275\\xa0mAh·g−1 is regained after suddenly returning the initial current density back to 0.1\\xa0A·g−1 and in the subsequent 200 cycles this composite architecture anode still delivers a capacity of 332\\xa0mAh·g−1). The kinetics analysis indicates superior pseudocapacitive property, high electronic conductivity, and favorable sodium-ion adsorption and diffusion capability, confirming fast sodium storage performance. Impressively, ex-situ X-ray diffraction and selected area electron diffraction characterizations corroborate the formation of NaSi6 as the main sodiation products during the reversible evolutions of cycled proceeding with sodium-ion insertion. This work sheds light on the elaborate design of silicon-based nanostructured anodes towards advanced high-performance sodium-ion batteries.Graphical abstract',\n",

Herein, by coupling silver nanowires (AgNWs) between MXene interlayers with the help of bacterial cellulose (BC) as bio-dispersant toward MXene/AgNWs&BC hybrid cathode to pair with Zn anode, a novel Zn2+-Cl− dual-ions micro-redox capacitor (MRC) employing polyacrylamide/ZnCl2 + NH4Cl hydrogel electrolyte is first present. The introduced AgNWs nanopillars alleviate the MXene nanosheets restacking to facilitate Cl− transfer kinetics, and concurrently strengthen the charge storage capacity and output stability benefiting from a flat discharge plateau stemming from the extra phase transition behavior (Ag⇔AgCl). Thus, an appealing dual energy storage mechanism, featuring i) expedited Cl− diffusion involved de/intercalation and ii)\\xa0reversible solid-to-solid conversion of Ag/AgCl redox couple confined between MXene interlayers, is established and revealed by in situ XRD/Raman analyses.

Despite tremendous research efforts, the development of advanced shielding materials is still needed to provide additional functionalities for various artificial-intelligence-driven systems, such as tactile sensing ability. Herein, a layering design strategy is proposed to fabricate ultrathin Ti3C2Tx MXene-aramid nanofiber (MA) films by a layer-by-layer assembling process. Compared to that of randomly mixed films, the designed MA films exhibited a higher EMI shielding efficiency at an ultrathin thickness of 9 µm, which increased from 26.4 to 40.7 dB, owing to the additional multiple-interface scattering mechanism. Importantly, the novel MA films displayed strong EMI shielding ability even after heating/cooling treatments within a wide temperature range of −196 to 300 °C. Moreover, the same material displayed a tensile strength of 124.1 ± 2.7 MPa and a toughness of 6.3 ± 1.1 MJ·m−3, which are approximately 9.1 times and 45 times higher than those of pure MXene films, respectively. The MA film is also capable of detecting tactile signals via the triboelectric effect. A 2 × 4 tactile sensor array was developed to achieve an accurate signal catching capability. Therefore, in addition to the shielding performance, the manifestation of tactile perception by the MA films offers exciting opportunities in the fields of soft robotics and human-machine interactions.',\n",

The use of MXene electrodes improves the responsivity and reduces dark current, compared with traditional Metal-Semiconductor-Metal (MSM) photodetectors using Cr/Au electrodes. Dark current of the device using MXene-GaN van der Waals junctions is reduced by three orders of magnitude and its noise spectral intensity shows distinct improvement compared with the traditional Cr/Au–GaN–Cr/Au MSM photodetector. The improved device performance is attributed to low-defect MXene-GaN van der Waals interfaces. Thanks to the high quality MXene-GaN interfaces, it is possible to verify that the patterned substrate can locally improve both light extraction and photocurrent collection. The measured responsivity and specific detectivity reach as high as 64.6\\u2009A/W and 1.93\\u2009×\\u20091012 Jones, respectively, making it a potential candidate for underwater optical detection and communication.

Findings from activation energy calculation for non-isothermal crystallization came to the same conclusion. Thermal gravity (TG) analysis of MXene/LLDPE nanocomposites was conducted at different heating rates, and the TG thermograms suggested the nanocomposites showed an improvement in thermal stability.

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\n\\nMXenes have been widely used as substrates of hybrid electrocatalysts for water splitting due to their stability and metallic properties. However, tuning MXenes towards superb hydrogen/oxygen evolution reaction (HER/OER) activity has remained elusive. Using first-principles calculations along with machine learning (ML) based descriptors, it is shown that late transition metal doping is able to significantly promote HER/OER activities. Both single-atom adsorption onto a stable hollow site above the outer oxygen layer single-atom catalyst 1 (SAC1), and single-atom replacement at a sub-surface metal layer (SAC2) are considered. An adsorbate evolving mechanism (AEM) is preferred for SAC1, while the increased M-O bond covalency for SAC2 makes lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) favored. It is found that a single Ni or Co atom embedded into MXenes provides a suitable number of electrons for optimal AEM and raises the O 2p band towards activated LOM. The stability and superb bifunctional catalytic capability of MXene combinations (Ni-doped Sc3N2O2 and Ni-doped Nb3C2O2) towards both HER and OER are demonstrated. The electronic and geometric descriptors used in the ML analysis work universally for classification of high-performing HER/OER catalysts. This work provides a rational strategy for promoting bifunctional electrocatalytic activities based on low-cost MXenes metals.',\n",

Herein, 2D Mo2CTx flakes with high aspect ratio are successfully synthesized. The chemiresistive effect in a sub-µm MXene multilayer for different organic vapors and humidity at 101–104\\xa0ppm in dry air is studied. Reasonably, the low-noise resistance signal allows the detection of H2O down to 10\\xa0ppm. Moreover, humidity suppresses the response of Mo2CTx to organic analytes due to the blocking of adsorption active sites. By measuring the impedance of MXene layers as a function of ac frequency in the 10−2–106\\xa0Hz range, it is shown that operation principle of the sensor is dominated by resistance change rather than capacitance variations. The sensor transfer function allows to conclude that the Mo2CTx chemiresistance is mainly originating from electron transport through interflake potential barriers with heights up to 0.2\\xa0eV. Density functional theory calculations, elucidating the Mo2C surface interaction with organic analytes and H2O, explain the experimental data as an energy shift of the density of states under the analyte's adsorption which induces increasing electrical resistance.\",\n",

Amphiphilic structure of ethylene glycol allows the dispersion of water and MXene nanoflakes appropriately. The studied nanofluids are prepared with a mixture of 70 % of EG and 30% of deionized water. The prepared aqueous EG is mixed with Ti3C2 nanoflakes with three different loading concentrations of 0.02, 0.05, and 0.1 wt.%. The Fourier Transform Infrared spectrum (FTIR) of the aqueous EG/MXene nanofluids is measured using a Perkin Elmer Spectrum Two-Universal ATR. Particle analyzer is used to measure the stability of the prepared nanofluids. The experimentally achieved data represents the highest stability with mean zeta potential value of -92.6 mV for aqueous EG/MXene with a loading concentration of 0.02 wt.%. Optical absorbance measurements are performed using Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy. Perkin Elmer Lambda 750 is used to acquire spectra. The result of the observation indicates that the solution of nanofluid with a loading concentration of 0.1 wt. % of Ti3C2 exhibits the highest peak magnitude of light absorbance among the rest of the three samples. This is because of the more mass concentration value of that nanofluid solution, which is proportional to light absorption. Due to the hydrophilic nature of the utilized nanomaterial and base fluid, there is an excellent probability for them to form a potential homogenous mixture of nanofluid, which might accomplish high optical performance in terms of applying at the solar system.',\n",

In this paper, a new ultra-thin two-dimensional conductive material Ti3C2 MXene was used as the substrate, on which the Pd2+ ions were loaded, and could be reduced to Pd. The composite Pd@Ti3C2 with different Pd contents were prepared. The performance of the Pd particles on the surface of the two-dimensional Ti3C2 nanosheets was tested. The results showed that the nanoscaled Pd could promote the reduction of nitrogen. When the addition ratio of Pd was 5%, the compound showed the best performance and good stability.

So far, 20 different MXene compositions have been synthesized and many more are theoretically predicted. However, since most MXenes are chemically unstable in their 2D forms, to date only one MXene composition, Ti3C2Tx, has shown stable pseudocapacitive charge storage. Here, a cation-driven assembly process is demonstrated to fabricate highly stable and flexible multilayered films of V2CTx and Ti2CTx MXenes from their chemically unstable delaminated single-layer flakes. The electrochemical performance of electrodes fabricated using assembled V2CTx flakes surpasses Ti3C2Tx in various aqueous electrolytes. These electrodes show specific capacitances as high as 1315 F cm−3 and retain ≈77% of their initial capacitance after one million charge/discharge cycles, an unprecedented performance for pseudocapacitive materials.

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\n\\nA class of 2D layered materials exhibits substantial potential for high-performance electrocatalysts due to high specific surface area, tunable electronic properties, and open 2D channels for fast ion transport. However, liquid-phase exfoliation always utilizes organic solvents that are harmful to the environment, and the active sites are limited to edge sites. Here, an environmentally friendly exfoliator in aqueous solution is presented without utilizing any toxic or hazardous substance and active site self-assembly on the inert base of 2D materials. Benefiting from thin 2D/2D heterostructure and strong interfacial coupling, the resultant highly disordered amorphous NiFe/2D materials (Ti3C2 MXene, graphene and MoS2) thin nanosheets exhibit extraordinary electrocatalytic performance toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. DFT results further verify the experimental results. The study emphasizes a viable idea to probe efficient electrocatalysts by means of the synergistic effect of environmentally friendly exfoliator in aqueous solution and active site self-assembly on the inert base of 2D materials which forms the unique thin 2D/2D heterostructure in-suit. This new type of heterostructure opens up a novel avenue for the rational design of highly efficient 2D materials for electrocatalysis.',\n",

Among diverse strategies for achieving theranostic capabilities, surface-nanopore engineering based on mesoporous silica coating has attracted great interest because of their negligible cytotoxicity and chemically active surface that can be easily modified to introduce various functional groups (e.g., −COOH, −NH2, −SH, etc.) via silanization, which can satisfy various requirements of conjugating biological molecules or functional nanoparticles. In addition, the nanopore-engineered biomaterials possess large surface area and high pore volume, ensuring desirable loading of therapeutic guest molecules. In this review, we comprehensively summarize the synthetic procedure/paradigm of nanopore engineering and further broad theranostic applications. Such nanopore-engineering strategy endows the biocompatible nanocomposites (e.g., Au, Ag, graphene, upconversion nanoparticles, Fe3O4, MXene, etc.) with versatile functional moieties, which enables the development of multifunctional nanoplatforms for multimodal diagnostic bio-imaging, photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy, targeted drug delivery, synergetic therapy and imaging-guided therapies. Therefore, mesoporous silica-based surface-nanopore engineering integrates intriguing unique features for broadening the biomedical applications of the single mono-functional nanosystem, facilitating the development and further clinical translation of theranostic nanomedicine.',\n",

Yet the EMI shielding materials capable of versatility still remains a challenge.

Attributing to the intact conduction of MXene layer and the multiple-reflection-absorption effect, the multilayered membrane achieved an optimum shielding efficiency (SE) of 55.4\\xa0dB. The predominant conductivity of MXene rendered the multilayered membrane remarkable Joule heating performance with a rapid temperature response from 31\\xa0°C to 52.8\\xa0°C within 25s at a low trigger voltage of 1.5\\xa0V. The triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) based on the multilayered membrane exhibited outstanding energy generation with a peak power density of 457.1\\xa0mW/m2.

       "  'abstract': 'Spatial self-phase modulation (SSPM) as a purely coherent non-linear optical effect (also known as Kerr effect) can support strong broadband phase modulation, which is essential for all-optical applications. Besides this, the increasing use of two-dimensional (2D) materials opens up new prospects in this field of research. In this work, we report a broadband SSPM response from 2D transition metal carbonitrides (MXenes) and Nb2C, arising in the near-infrared (1,550 nm) range. Based on the SSPM measurements of few-layer Nb2C nanosheets, the third-order non-linear optical parameters of Nb2C, including the non-linear refractive index n2 and susceptibility χ(3), were determined at 400, 800, 1,300, and 1,550 nm. Moreover, the physics mechanism of the dynamic formation process of SSPM diffraction rings was exploited. The formation time of SSPM diffraction rings can be divided into two typical parts which correspond to the polarization and reorientation of 2D Nb2C nanosheets. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the nonreciprocal light propagation at wavelengths of 1,300 and 1,550 nm by constructing an Nb2C/water hybrid structure. Our results reveal strong optical phase modulation of Nb2C in the infrared region, thus showing the great potential of MXene materials for use in passive photonic devices.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'MXenes are a family two-dimensional transition-metal carbide and nitride materials, which often exhibit very good metallic conductivity and are thus of great interest for applications in, e.g., flexible electronics, electrocatalysis, and electromagnetic interference shielding. However, surprisingly little is known about the fermiology of MXenes, i.e., the shape and size of their Fermi surfaces, and its effect on the material properties. One reason for this may be that MXene surfaces are almost always covered by a mixture of functional groups, and studying Fermi surfaces of disordered systems is cumbersome. Here, we study fermiology of four common Ti-based MXenes as a function of the surface functional group composition. We first calculate the effective band structures of systems with explicit mixed surfaces and observe gradual evolution in the filling of the Ti-d band and resulting shift of Fermi level. We then demonstrate that these band structures can be closely approximated by using pseudohydrogenated surfaces, and also compare favorably to the experimental angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy results. By modifying the pseudohydrogen charge we then proceed to plot Fermi surfaces for all systems and extract their properties, such as the Fermi-surface area and average Fermi velocity. These are in turn used to evaluate the electrical conductivity with the relaxation time fitted to experimentally measured conductivities.',\n",

Similar with other 2D materials, MXenes generally suffer severe self-agglomeration, low capacity, and unsatisfied durability, particularly for larger sodium/potassium ions, compromising their practical values. In this work, a novel ternary heterostructure self-assembled from transition metal selenides (MSe, M\\u2009=\\u2009Cu, Ni, and Co), MXene nanosheets and N-rich carbonaceous nanoribbons (CNRibs) with ultrafast ion transport properties is designed for sluggish sodium-ion (SIB) and potassium-ion (PIB) batteries. Benefiting from the diverse chemical characteristics, the positively charged MSe anchored onto the electronegative hydroxy (–OH) functionalized MXene surfaces through electrostatic adsorption, while the fungal-derived CNRibs bonded with the other side of MXene through amino bridging and hydrogen bonds. This unique MXene-based heterostructure prevents the restacking of 2D materials, increases the intrinsic conductivity, and most importantly, provides ultrafast interfacial ion transport pathways and extra surficial and interfacial storage sites, and thus, boosts the high-rate storage performances in SIB and PIB applications. Both the quantitatively kinetic analysis and the density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the interfacial ion transport is several orders higher than that of the pristine MXenes, which delivered much enhanced Na+ (536.3 mAh g−1@ 0.1 A g−1) and K+ (305.6 mAh g−1@ 1.0 A g−1 ) storage capabilities and excellent long-term cycling stability. Therefore, this work provides new insights into 2D materials engineering and low-cost, but kinetically sluggish post-Li batteries.',\n",

Herein, we offer a new approach to achieve a cross-talk between innate and adaptive immune responses based on a new nanoplatform for photothermal therapeutics. The nanoplatform was formed by linking titanium carbide MXene with Mn2+-contained ovalbumin (OVA), where it can trigger efficient mt-DNA presentation and the release of OVA and Mn2+ upon the irradiation of near-infrared laser. More importantly, the released mt-DNA and Mn2+ synergistically activate innate immunity via the cGAS-stimulator of the interferon genes signaling pathway, and the OVA and protein antigens from tumor cells enhance adaptive immunity. Furthermore, in an osteosarcoma model, we observed that the proposed nanoplatform leads to the effective presentation of tumor antigens, which boost the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) to the hilt and thus improve the infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocyte in primary and distant tumors. Collectively, our work not only demonstrates a method for constructing a new nanoplatform for photothermal therapeutics but also provides a general strategy for synchronously activating innate and adaptive immunities to promote the maturation of DCs for antimetastasis tumor therapy.Graphical abstractUpon irradiation, tumor-derived antigen and mt-DNA release from dying tumors which recruits the DCs in situ. And TPOM NPs decompose into Mn2+ and OVA under NIR. Immature DCs (iDCs) would uptake the OVA and antigen which promote DCs maturation through the adaptive immunity.

In this study, fatty diamines and aromatic diamines with different molecular sizes are inserted between MXene interlayers as pillars through a one-step amination process to inhibit the self-stacking and obtain different expanded interlayer spacings with improved antioxidant stability. X-ray diffraction results show that interlayer spacing of MXene increases from 1.23 to 1.40\\xa0nm. The p-phenylenediamine-intercalated MXene (PDA-MXene) exhibits better matching interlayer spacing (1.38\\xa0nm) and pore structure for improved electrolyte-accessible surface area, enhanced charge-transport properties, and promoted Zn2+ ions storage. Therefore, zinc-ion hybrid supercapacitor (ZHSC) using PDA-MXene as cathode exhibits higher specific capacitance (124.4 F g−1 at 0.2 A g−1) in 2 m ZnSO4 electrolyte together with outstanding cycling stability (85% capacity retention after 10\\xa0000 cycles at 1 A g−1).

By a simple hydrothermal method, vanadium-doped Ti3C2Tx 2D nanosheets are prepared to tune the interaction between MXene and alkali metal adsorbates (Li+, Na+, and K+) in the neutral electrolyte. Maintaining the 2D morphology of MXene, the coexisting V3+ and V4+ are confirmed to form surface V–C and V–O species. At a medium doping level of V:Ti = 0.17:1, the V-doped MXene exhibits the highest capacitance of 365.9 F g−1 in 2 m KCl (10 mV s−1) and excellent stability (5% loss after 5000 cycles), compared to only 115.7 F g−1 of pristine MXene. Density functional theory calculations reveal the stronger alkali metal ion–O interaction on V-doped MXene surface than unmodified MXene and a further capacitance boost to 404.9 F g−1 using Li+-containing neutral electrolyte is reported, which is comparable to the performance under acidic conditions.',\n",

Due to their special properties, such as mechanoceramic nature with excellent mechanical performance, thermal stability and rich surface properties, MXenes have tremendous potential as advanced composite structures, especially those based on polymers due to a great affinity between macromolecules and the terminating groups of 2D MXenes. MXenes have been extensively explored in metal matrix nanocomposites as well as in solid- or liquid-based lubrication systems owing to the 2D structure and antifriction characteristics. The purpose of the this paper is to provide a comprehensive insight into the material, mechanical, and tribological properties of the MXene nanolayers with discussions on the recent advancements attained from MXene-reinforced nanocomposites starting with the synthesis, fabrication techniques, intricacies of the underlying physics and mechanisms, and finally focusing on the progress in computational studies.

       "  'abstract': 'MXenes are a recently discovered family of two-dimensional (2D) early transition metal carbides and carbonitrides, which have already shown many attractive properties and great promise in energy storage and many other applications. However, a complex surface chemistry and small coherence length have been obstacles in some applications of MXenes, also limiting the accuracy of predictions of their properties. In this study, we describe and benchmark a novel way of modeling layered materials with real interfaces (diverse surface functional groups and stacking order between the adjacent monolayers) against experimental data. The structures of three kinds of Ti3C2Tx MXenes (T stands for surface terminating species, including O, OH, and F) produced under different synthesis conditions were resolved for the first time using atomic pair distribution function obtained by high-quality neutron total scattering. The true nature of the material can be easily captured with the sensitivity of neutron scattering to the surface species of interest and the detailed “third-generation” structure model we present. The modeling approach leads to new understanding of MXene structural properties and can replace the currently used idealized models in predictions of a variety of physical, chemical, and functional properties of Ti3C2-based MXenes. The developed models can be employed to guide the design of new MXene materials with selected surface termination and controlled contact angle, catalytic, optical, electrochemical, and other properties. We suggest that the multilevel structural modeling should form the basis for a generalized methodology on modeling diffraction and pair distribution function data for 2D and layered materials.',\n",

However, after dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) delamination, the effect of surface functionalities in Ti3C2Tx is still unclear and there are no systematic reports on its capacitive behavior. Experiments and theoretical calculations confirm the relationship between different surface functionalities, the DMSO delamination effect, and the electrochemical behavior of the DMSO-delaminated Ti3C2Tx. The dominant −O and −OH terminations are attributed for surfaces delaminated by using HF [Ti3C2Tx\\u2009(HF)] and LiF/HCl [Ti3C2Tx\\u2009(LiF/HCl)], respectively. Theoretical results are also in agreement with experimental results in that −OH terminations are essential for the formation of a free-standing film. Compared to non-delaminated Ti3C2Tx\\u2009(HF) (similar O/F ratios of 1.37 and 1.42), there is a significant DMSO delamination effect for Ti3C2Tx\\u2009(LiF/HCl) because of different O/F ratios of 2.9 and 3.6.

       "  'abstract': 'Electrochromic materials and devices are attracting intense attention because of their low energy consumption and open-circuit memory effect. Considering the difficult processing characteristics of electrochromic conductive polymers, we developed a facile and scalable strategy to prepare solution processable polyaniline (PANI)-based nanocomposites by introducing two-dimensional titanium carbon nanosheets (MXene) through a self-assembly approach. The PANI/MXene nanocomposite can be fabricated into porous films via spray-coating process, which show an obvious synergetic effect of both materials, leading to superior electrochromic properties. The optical contrast of the optimized PANI/MXene film reached as high as 55% at =700 nm, and its response times were 1.3 s for coloration and 2.0 s for bleaching, respectively. In addition, the composite film also showed excellent cycle stability (after 500 cycles, the ΔT retention was above 87%). The improved electrochromic properties are owed to the high conductivity of MXene and the formation of the porous composite film structure, which promote the electronic/ionic transfer and migration efficiency. This research suggests that the self-assembly method and the conductive polymer/MXene nanocomposites have a potential application in the fields of electronic functional films and devices.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In this study, a novel sensor with high sensitivity and linear was prepared based on two-dimensional (2D) material (MXene) and ink, which can be used for deformation and damage monitoring of structural composites. The MXene was efficiently prepared by etching Ti3AlC2 powder with LiF–HCl solution and subsequent vacuum drying. The viscosity and adhesion of MXene/ink composites were controlled by changing the ratio of solvent (dimethyl sulfoxide) to ink. The MXene/ink was printed on the surface of the composite material to avoid forming defects in the composite material. The percolation threshold of the MXene/ink nanocomposite was relatively low, 3.6wt%. In this paper, MXene/ink composites with different contents were selected as the sensor, and the characteristics of the sensor were verified through monotone stretch and cyclic load-and-unload tests. When the MXene content just exceeds the percolation threshold (4wt%), the gauge factor (GF) of the sensor is higher, the results of monotonic tensile experiment show that there are two different sensitive stages of linear change (0\\u2009~\\u20090.477%) and (0.477\\u2009~\\u20091.37%), and the range GF is116.6 and 554.3, respectively. In addition, the linear relationship and sensitivity of the sensor remained stable after loading and unloading tensile tests.

However, owing to the highly hydrophilic nature of MXene nanosheets, assembly strategies of MXene at liquid–liquid interfaces have been very limited and challenging. Herein, through the cooperative assembly of MXene and amine-functionalized polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane at the oil–water interface, we report the formation, assembly, and jamming of a new type MXene-based Janus-like nanoparticle surfactants, termed MXene-surfactants (MXSs), which can significantly enhance the interfacial activity of MXene nanosheets. More importantly, this simple assembly strategy opens a new platform for the fabrication of functional MXene assemblies from mesoscale (e.g., structured liquids) to macroscale (e.g., aerogels), that can be used for a range of applications, including nanocomposites, electronic devices, and all-liquid microfluidic devices.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\n\\nA strategy to prepare flexible and conductive MXene/graphene (reduced graphene oxide, rGO) supercapacitor electrodes by using electrostatic self-assembly between positively charged rGO modified with poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) and negatively charged titanium carbide MXene nanosheets is presented. After electrostatic assembly, rGO nanosheets are inserted in-between MXene layers. As a result, the self-restacking of MXene nanosheets is effectively prevented, leading to a considerably increased interlayer spacing. Accelerated diffusion of electrolyte ions enables more electroactive sites to become accessible. The freestanding MXene/rGO-5 wt% electrode displays a volumetric capacitance of 1040 F cm−3 at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1 , an impressive rate capability with 61% capacitance retention at 1 V s−1 and long cycle life. Moreover, the fabricated binder-free symmetric supercapacitor shows an ultrahigh volumetric energy density of 32.6 Wh L−1, which is among the highest values reported for carbon and MXene based materials in aqueous electrolytes. This work provides fundamental insight into the effect of interlayer spacing on the electrochemical performance of 2D hybrid materials and sheds light on the design of next-generation flexible, portable and highly integrated supercapacitors with high volumetric and rate performances.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract\\n\\n2D MXenes have shown great promise in electrochemical and electromagnetic shielding applications. However, their potential use in electronic devices is significantly less explored. The unique combination of metallic conductivity and hydrophilic surface suggests that MXenes can also be promising in electronics and sensing applications. Here, it is shown that metallic Ti3C2 MXene with work function of 4.60 eV can make good electrical contact with both zinc oxide (ZnO) and tin monoxide (SnO) semiconductors, with negligible band offsets. Consequently, both n-type ZnO and p-type SnO thin-film transistors (TFTs) have been fabricated entirely using large-area MXene (Ti3C2) electrical contacts, including gate, source, and drain. The n- and p-type TFTs show balanced performance, including field-effect mobilities of 2.61 and 2.01 cm2 V−1 s−1 and switching ratios of 3.6 × 106 and 1.1 × 103, respectively. Further, complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) inverters are demonstrated. The CMOS inverters show large voltage gain of 80 and excellent noise margin of 3.54 V, which is 70.8% of the ideal value. Moreover, the operation of CMOS inverters is shown to be very stable under a 100 Hz square waveform input. The current results suggest that MXene (Ti3C2) can play an important role as contact material in nanoelectronics.',\n",

Besides, ultrafast carrier dynamics of Nb2CTx nanosheets were also investigated by using pump-probe technique. It was found that the relaxation contains a biexponential decay process with two decay components, a fast and a slow one. The investigations show that Nb2CTx nanosheets can be used as building ultrashort pulse generation and optoelectronic devices.',\n",

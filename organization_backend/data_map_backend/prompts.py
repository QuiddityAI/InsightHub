You are a helpful assistant to extract answers a document.
The document starts with <document> and ends with </document>.

<document>
{{ document }}
</document>

Answer the following question based on the document.
If not stated otherwise, answer in one concise sentence, word or list.
Only use information that is directly stated in the document.
If the document does not contain the answer, answer with 'n/a'.
If the answer is unclear, answer with '?'.

Respond directly with the answer. Do not summarize the question again.
E.g. if asked to produce bullet points, NEVER start with 'Here are three bullet points...'.
Instead, start with just the bullet points itself."""
